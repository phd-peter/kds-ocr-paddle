<div style="text-align: center;">Theodore V. Galambos, P.E., Ph.D., DM.ASCE, M.NAE</div>


This edition of the AISC Specification is dedicated to Dr. Theodore (Ted) V. Galambos, a long-time member of the AISC Committee on Specifications and several of its Task Committees. His pivotal research and publications on the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method transformed the AISC Specification. This method of designing steel buildings was first introduced in the 1986 AISC Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings. Ted led the effort to adopt this new method and helped maintain it through numerous editions of the Specification. Ted was also the co-author of the Development of a Probability Based Load Criterion for American National Standard, the document on which ASCE/SEI 7 is based. For his contributions to research, development, and teaching of behavior, analysis, and design of steel structures, and application of probabilistic methods, Ted was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1979 and as a Distinguished Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 1990.

In addition to his work on code committees, Ted has been directly involved with numerous other publications that have promoted the state-of-the-art of structural steel design and construction, including as author of Structural Members and Frames (1968) and senior author of Basic Steel Design with LRFD (1996), as well as serving as editor of the 4th and 5th editions of the Guide to Stability Design Criteria for Metal Structures (1988, 1998). He has also continually demonstrated a commitment to the practice of engineering by serving as a consultant to industry through his activities with AISC, the Steel Joist Institute, and the American Iron and Steel Institute.

After receiving his doctorate from Lehigh University in 1959, Ted became a Research Assistant Professor at Lehigh University. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, his research focused on the stability behavior and plastic design of steel beam-columns and multistory steel frames. While at Lehigh, he conducted fundamental tests on the inelastic behavior of steel wide-flange members. In 1965, Ted moved to Washington University in St. Louis as the first holder of the Harold D. Jolley Professorship, and he served as Department Chair from 1970 to 1978. At this time, Ted also began his ground-breaking research on LRFD of structures. Ted was appointed the James L. Record Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1981, where he continued a distinguished record of research, teaching, and service through professional committee activities, including ASCE, the Structural Stability Research Council, the Transportation Research Board, and the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering.

As a professor, Ted is a beloved teacher who instructed many future engineers in steel design with an exemplary blending of theory and practice. Ted's commitment to sharing his knowledge, his willingness to mentor several generations of young researchers, and his strong ethical standards have made him one of the giants of his generation. His contributions on the behavior of steel structures will have a lasting impact on the structural engineering profession.

# PREFACE

(This Preface is not part of ANSI/AISC 360-22, Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, but is included for informational purposes only.)

This Specification is based upon past successful usage, advances in the state of knowledge, and changes in design practice. The 2022 American Institute of Steel Construction's Specification for Structural Steel Buildings provides an integrated treatment of allowable strength design (ASD) and load and resistance factor design (LRFD), and replaces earlier Specifications. As indicated in Chapter B of the Specification, designs can be made according to either ASD or LRFD provisions.

This ANSI-approved Specification has been developed as a consensus document using ANSI-accredited procedures to provide a uniform practice in the design of steel-framed buildings and other structures. The intention is to provide design criteria for routine use and not to provide specific criteria for infrequently encountered problems that occur in the full range of structural design.

This Specification is the result of the consensus deliberations of a committee of structural engineers with wide experience and high professional standing, representing a wide geographical distribution throughout the United States. The committee includes approximately equal numbers of engineers in private practice and code agencies, engineers involved in research and teaching, and engineers employed by steel fabricating and producing companies. The contributions and assistance of more than 50 additional professional volunteers working in task committees are also hereby acknowledged.

The Symbols, Glossary, Abbreviations, and Appendices to this Specification are an integral part of the Specification. A nonmandatory Commentary has been prepared to provide background for the Specification provisions and the user is encouraged to consult it. Additionally, nonmandatory User Notes are interspersed throughout the Specification to provide concise and practical guidance in the application of the provisions.

A number of significant technical modifications have also been made since the 2016 edition of the Specification, including the following:

• A new table is incorporated into Section A3 that lists allowable grades and strengths and other specific limitations of referenced materials.

• Section J3 adopts ASTM F3148 bolts that provide a strength of 144 ksi. A new combined installation method is incorporated into Chapter J applicable to these bolts by reference to the RCSC Specification.

• Section A4 provides a detailed list related to what information must be provided on structural design documents. These criteria have been moved from the Code of Standard Practice for Structural Steel Buildings.

• A new Section A5, Approvals, is added to specifically address the review and approval of approval documents.

• A new Section B8, Dimensional Tolerances, is added to clarify that the provisions of the Specification are based on specific tolerances provided in the Code of Standard Practice and referenced ASTM standards.

• Provisions are added in Section E4 for doubly symmetric I-shaped compression members to address lateral bracing that is offset from the shear center.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_1/doc_7.md -->

• For flexural strength of members with holes in the tension flange, it is clarified that the Section F13.1 provisions apply only to bolt holes.

• Provisions are added to Chapter G to permit tension field action in end panels.

• Provisions are added to Chapter H for HSS subjected to combined forces, to include biaxial bending and shear.

• Provisions are added to Chapter I for longitudinal and transverse reinforcing steel requirements for filled composite columns and for both encased composite and filled composite beams.

• Chapter I now includes additional stiffness and strength provisions for concrete filled composite plate shear walls consisting of two steel plates connected by tie bars.

• Provisions for the design of rectangular filled composite members constructed from materials with strengths above the limits noted in Chapter I are added in a new Appendix 2.

• Section J2 provides revised requirements to qualify partial-joint-penetration groove welds with effective throats larger than those prescribed in AWS D1.1/D1.1M.

• Requirements regarding the use of low-hydrogen electrodes as they relate to minimum size fillet welds are revised in Table J2.4.

• The directional strength increase for transversely loaded fillet welds is rewritten and prohibited for use in the ends of rectangular HSS.

• An alternative bolt tensile strength based on the net tensile area of bolts is added.

• Added limit states for rectangular HSS moment connections in Chapter K.

• Section N4 now addresses coating inspection personnel requirements.

• A new Section N8, Minimum Requirements for Shop or Field Applied Coatings, is added.

• Appendix 2, Design for Ponding, is removed and replaced with updated guidance on this topic in Section B3.10.

• Appendix 3 clarifies hole forming provisions for elements subjected to fatigue.

• Appendix 4 incorporates temperature-dependent stress-strain equations from the Eurocode to provide material properties for steel at elevated temperatures.

• Prescriptive steel fire-protection design equations and related information based on standard ASTM E119 fire tests are incorporated into Appendix 4.

• Appendix 4, Section 4.4d, Design by Simple Methods of Analysis, includes provisions for compressive strength in filled composite columns and for compression in filled composite plate shear walls.

• Provisions for calculating rivet strength are added in Appendix 5.

# CHAPTER A GENERAL PROVISIONS

This chapter states the scope of this Specification, lists referenced specifications, codes, and standards, and provides requirements for materials and structural design documents.

The chapter is organized as follows:

A1. Scope

A2. Referenced Specifications, Codes, and Standards

A3. Material

A4. Structural Design Documents and Specifications

A5. Approvals

### A1. SCOPE

The Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (ANSI/AISC 360), hereafter referred to as this Specification, shall apply to the design, fabrication, erection, and quality of the structural steel system or systems with structural steel acting compositely with reinforced concrete, where the steel elements are defined in Section 2.1 of the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (ANSI/AISC 303), hereafter referred to as the Code of Standard Practice.

This Specification includes the Symbols, Glossary, Abbreviations, Chapters A through N, and Appendices 1 through 8. The Commentary to this Specification and the User Notes interspersed throughout are not part of this Specification. The phrases "is permitted" and "are permitted" in this document identify provisions that comply with this Specification, but are not mandatory.

User Note: User notes are intended to provide concise and practical guidance in the application of the Specification provisions.

This Specification sets forth criteria for the design, fabrication, and erection of structural steel buildings and other structures, where other structures are defined as structures designed, fabricated, and erected in a manner similar to buildings, with building-like vertical and lateral load-resisting elements.

Wherever this Specification refers to the applicable building code and there is none, the loads, load combinations, system limitations, and general design requirements shall be those in ASCE Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE/SEI 7).

Where conditions are not covered by this Specification, designs are permitted to be based on tests or analysis, subject to the approval of the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ). Alternative methods of analysis and design are permitted, provided such alternative methods or criteria are acceptable to the AHJ.

User Note: Unidentified steel may be used for details where the precise mechanical properties and weldability are not of concern. These are commonly curb plates, shims, and other similar pieces.

### 1 d. Rolled Heavy Shapes

ASTM A6/A6M hot-rolled shapes with a flange thickness exceeding 2 in. (50 mm) are considered to be rolled heavy shapes. Rolled heavy shapes used as members subjected to primary (computed) tensile forces due to tension or flexure and spliced or connected using complete-joint-penetration groove welds that fuse through the thickness of the flange or the flange and the web shall be specified as follows. The structural design documents shall require that such shapes be supplied with Charpy V-notch (CVN) impact test results in accordance with ASTM A6/A6M, Supplementary Requirement S30, Charpy V-Notch Impact Test for Structural Shapes—Alternate Core Location. The impact test shall meet a minimum average value of 20 ft-lbf (27 J) absorbed energy at a maximum temperature of  $ +70^{\circ} $ F ( $ +21^{\circ} $ C).

The requirements in this section do not apply if the splices and connections are made by bolting. Where a rolled heavy shape is welded to the surface of another shape using groove welds, the requirements apply only to the shape that has weld metal fused through the cross section.

User Note: Additional requirements for rolled heavy-shape welded joints are given in Sections J1.5, J1.6, J2.6, and M2.2.

### 1 e. Built-Up Heavy Shapes

Built-up cross sections consisting of plates with a thickness exceeding 2 in. (50 mm) are considered built-up heavy shapes. Built-up heavy shapes used as members subjected to primary (computed) tensile forces due to tension or flexure and spliced or connected to other members using complete-joint-penetration groove welds that fuse through the thickness of the plates, shall be specified as follows. The structural design documents shall require that the steel be supplied with Charpy V-notch impact test results in accordance with ASTM A6/A6M, Supplementary Requirement S5, Charpy V-Notch Impact Test. The impact test shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM A673/A673M, Frequency P, and shall meet a minimum average value of 20 ft-lbf (27 J) absorbed energy at a maximum temperature of  $ +70^{\circ} $ F ( $ +21^{\circ} $ C).

When a built-up heavy shape is welded to the face of another member using groove welds, these requirements apply only to the shape that has weld metal fused through the cross section.

User Note: Additional requirements for built-up heavy-shape welded joints are given in Sections J1.5, J1.6, J2.6, and M2.2.

# CHAPTER B DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

This chapter addresses general requirements for the design of steel structures applicable to all chapters and appendices of this Specification.

The chapter is organized as follows:

B1. General Provisions

B2. Loads and Load Combinations

B3. Design Basis

B4. Member Properties

B5. Fabrication and Erection

B6. Quality Control and Quality Assurance

B7. Evaluation of Existing Structures

B8. Dimensional Tolerances

### B1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

The design of members and connections shall be consistent with the intended behavior of the structural system and the assumptions made in the structural analysis.

### B2. LOADS AND LOAD COMBINATIONS

The loads, nominal loads, and load combinations shall be those stipulated by the applicable building code. In the absence of a building code, the loads, nominal loads, and load combinations shall be those stipulated in Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE/SEI 7).

User Note: When using ASCE/SEI 7 for design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD), the load combinations in ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.3, apply. For design, according to Section B3.2 (ASD), the load combinations in ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.4, apply.

### B3. DESIGN BASIS

Design shall be such that no applicable strength or serviceability limit state shall be exceeded when the structure is subjected to all applicable load combinations.

Design for strength shall be performed according to the provisions for load and resistance factor design (LRFD) or to the provisions for allowable strength design (ASD).

User Note: The term “design,” as used in this Specification, is defined in the Glossary.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_3/doc_23.md -->

### 1. Design for Strength Using Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD)

Design according to the provisions for load and resistance factor design (LRFD) satisfies the requirements of this Specification when the design strength of each structural component equals or exceeds the required strength determined on the basis of the LRFD load combinations. All provisions of this Specification, except for those in Section B3.2, shall apply.

Design shall be performed in accordance with Equation B3-1:

 $$ R_{u}\leq\phi R_{n} $$ 

where

 $ R_{u} $  = required strength using LRFD load combinations

 $$ R_{n}\ =\ nominal\ strength $$ 

 $$ \begin{aligned}\phi\quad&=resistance factor\end{aligned} $$ 

 $$ \phi R_{n}=design strength $$ 

The nominal strength,  $ R_{n} $ , and the resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , for the applicable limit states are specified in Chapters D through K.

### 2. Design for Strength Using Allowable Strength Design (ASD)

Design according to the provisions for allowable strength design (ASD) satisfies the requirements of this Specification when the allowable strength of each structural component equals or exceeds the required strength determined on the basis of the ASD load combinations. All provisions of this Specification, except those of Section B3.1, shall apply.

Design shall be performed in accordance with Equation B3-2:

 $$ R_{a}\leq\frac{R_{n}}{\Omega} $$ 

where

 $$ R_{a}=required strength using ASD load combinations $$ 

 $$ R_{n}=\operatorname{nominal strength} $$ 

 $$ \Omega_{ 冮 }=safety factor $$ 

 $$ R_{n}/\Omega=allowable strength $$ 

The nominal strength,  $ R_{n} $ , and the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ , for the applicable limit states are specified in Chapters D through K.

### 3. Required Strength

The required strength of structural members and connections shall be determined by structural analysis for the applicable load combinations, as stipulated in Section B2.

Design by elastic or inelastic analysis is permitted. Requirements for analysis are stipulated in Chapter C and Appendix 1.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_3/doc_24.md -->

### 4. Design of Connections and Supports

Connection elements shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of Chapters J and K. The forces and deformations used in design of the connections shall be consistent with the intended performance of the connection and the assumptions used in the design of the structure. Self-limiting inelastic deformations of the connections are permitted.

At points of support, beams, girders, and trusses shall be restrained against rotation about their longitudinal axis unless it can be shown by analysis that the restraint is not required.

User Note: Code of Standard Practice Section 3.1.2 addresses communication of necessary information for the design of connections.

### 4 a. Simple Connections

A simple connection transmits a negligible moment. In the analysis of the structure, simple connections may be assumed to allow unrestrained relative rotation between the framing elements being connected. A simple connection shall have sufficient rotation capacity to accommodate the required rotation determined by the analysis of the structure.

### 4 b. Moment Connections

Two types of moment connections, fully restrained and partially restrained, are permitted, as specified below.

## (a) Fully restrained (FR) moment connections

A fully restrained (FR) moment connection transfers moment with a negligible rotation between the connected members. In the analysis of the structure, the connection may be assumed to allow no relative rotation. An FR connection shall have sufficient strength and stiffness to maintain the initial angle between the connected members at the strength limit states.

## (b) Partially restrained (PR) moment connections

Partially restrained (PR) moment connections transfer moments, but the relative rotation between connected members is not negligible. In the analysis of the structure, the moment-rotation response characteristics of any PR connection shall be included. The response characteristics of the PR connection shall be based on the technical literature or established by analytical or experimental means. The component elements of a PR connection shall have sufficient strength, stiffness, and deformation capacity such that the moment-rotation response can be realized up to and including the required strength of the connection.

### 5. Design of Diaphragms and Collectors

Diaphragms and collectors shall be designed for forces that result from loads, as stipulated in Section B2. They shall be designed in conformance with the provisions of Chapters C through K, as applicable.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_3/doc_25.md -->

### 6. Design of Anchorages to Concrete

Anchorage between steel and concrete acting compositely shall be designed in accordance with Chapter I. The design of column bases and anchor rods shall be in accordance with Chapter J.

### 7. Design for Stability

The structure and its elements shall be designed for stability in accordance with Chapter C.

### 8. Design for Serviceability

The overall structure and the individual members and connections shall be evaluated for serviceability limit states in accordance with Chapter L.

### 9. Design for Structural Integrity

When design for structural integrity is required by the applicable building code, the requirements in this section shall be met.

(a) Column splices shall have a nominal tensile strength equal to or greater than  $ D + L $  for the area tributary to the column between the splice and the splice or base immediately below,

where

D = nominal dead load, kips (N)

L = nominal live load, kips (N)

(b) Beam and girder end connections shall have a minimum nominal axial tensile strength equal to (i) two-thirds of the required vertical shear strength for design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD) or (ii) the required vertical shear strength for design according to Section B3.2 (ASD), but not less than 10 kips in either case.

(c) End connections of members bracing columns shall have a nominal tensile strength equal to or greater than (i) 1% of two-thirds of the required column axial strength at that level for design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD) or (ii) 1% of the required column axial strength at that level for design according to Section B3.2 (ASD).

The strength requirements for structural integrity in this section shall be evaluated independently of other strength requirements. For the purpose of satisfying these requirements, bearing bolts in connections with short-slotted holes parallel to the direction of the tension force and inelastic deformation of the connection are permitted.

### 10. Design for Ponding

The roof system shall be investigated through structural analysis to ensure stability and strength under ponding conditions unless the roof surface is configured to prevent the accumulation of water.

Ponding stability and strength analysis shall consider the effect of the deflections of the roof's structural framing under all applicable loads present at the onset of ponding and the subsequent accumulation of rainwater and snowmelt.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_3/doc_26.md -->

The nominal strength and resistance or safety factors for the applicable limit states are specified in Chapters D through K.

### 11. Design for Fatigue

Design of members and their connections shall consider fatigue in accordance with Appendix 3. Fatigue need not be considered for seismic effects or for the effects of wind loading on typical building lateral force-resisting systems and building enclosure components.

### 12. Design for Fire Conditions

Design for fire conditions shall satisfy the requirements stipulated in Appendix 4.

Two methods of design for fire conditions are provided in Appendix 4: (a) by analysis and (b) by qualification testing. Compliance with the fire-protection requirements in the applicable building code shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of Appendix 4.

User Note: Design by qualification testing is the prescriptive method specified in most building codes. Traditionally, on most projects where the architect is the prime professional, the architect has been the responsible party to specify and coordinate fire protection requirements. Design by analysis is a newer engineering approach to fire protection. Designation of the person(s) responsible for designing for fire conditions is a contractual matter to be addressed on each project. This section is not intended to create or imply a contractual requirement for the engineer of record responsible for the structural design or any other member of the design team.

### 13. Design for Corrosion Effects

Where corrosion could impair the strength or serviceability of a structure, structural components shall be designed to tolerate corrosion or shall be protected against corrosion.

### B4. MEMBER PROPERTIES

### 1. Classification of Sections for Local Buckling

For members subjected to axial compression, sections are classified as nonslender-element or slender-element sections. For a nonslender-element section, the width-to-thickness ratios of its compression elements shall not exceed  $ \lambda_{r} $  from Table B4.1a. If the width-to-thickness ratio of any compression element exceeds  $ \lambda_{r} $ , the section is a slender-element section.

For members subjected to flexure, sections are classified as compact, noncompact, or slender-element sections. For all sections addressed in Table B4.1b, flanges must be continuously connected to the web or webs. For a section to qualify as compact, the width-to-thickness ratios of its compression elements shall not exceed the limiting width-to-thickness ratios,  $ \lambda_{p} $ , from Table B4.1b. If the width-to-thickness ratio of

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_3/doc_27.md -->

one or more compression elements exceeds  $ \lambda_{p} $ , but does not exceed  $ \lambda_{r} $  from Table B4.1b, the section is noncompact. If the width-to-thickness ratio of any compression element exceeds  $ \lambda_{r} $ , the section is a slender-element section.

For cases where the web and flange are not continuously attached, consideration of element slenderness shall account for the unattached length of the elements and the appropriate plate buckling boundary conditions.

User Note: The Commentary discusses element slenderness when the web and flange are not continuously attached.

### 1 a. Unstiffened Elements

For unstiffened elements supported along only one edge parallel to the direction of the compression force, the width shall be taken as follows:

(a) For flanges of I-shaped members and tees, the width, b, is one-half the full-flange width,  $ b_{f} $ .

(b) For legs of angles and flanges of channels and zees, the width, b, is the full leg or flange width.

(c) For plates, the width, b, is the distance from the free edge to the first row of fasteners or line of welds.

(d) For stems of tees, d is the full depth of the section.

User Note: Refer to Table B4.1 for the graphic representation of unstiffened element dimensions.

### 1 b. Stiffened Elements

For stiffened elements supported along two edges parallel to the direction of the compression force, the width shall be taken as follows:

(a) For webs of rolled sections, h is the clear distance between flanges less the fillet at each flange;  $ h_{c} $  is twice the distance from the centroid to the inside face of the compression flange less the fillet or corner radius.

(b) For webs of built-up sections, h is the distance between adjacent lines of fasteners or the clear distance between flanges when welds are used, and  $ h_{c} $  is twice the distance from the centroid to the nearest line of fasteners at the compression flange or the inside face of the compression flange when welds are used;  $ h_{p} $  is twice the distance from the plastic neutral axis to the nearest line of fasteners at the compression flange or the inside face of the compression flange when welds are used.

(c) For flange plates in built-up sections, the width, b, is the distance between adjacent lines of fasteners or lines of welds.

User Note: Refer to Table B4.1 for the graphic representation of stiffened element dimensions.

For tapered flanges of rolled sections, the thickness is the nominal value halfway between the free edge and the corresponding face of the web.

### 2. Design Wall Thickness for HSS

The design wall thickness, t, shall be used in calculations involving the wall thickness of hollow structural sections (HSS). The design wall thickness, t, shall be taken equal to the nominal thickness for box sections and HSS produced according to ASTM A1065/A1065M or ASTM A1085/A1085M. For HSS produced according to other standards approved for use under this Specification, the design wall thickness, t, shall be taken equal to 0.93 times the nominal wall thickness.

User Note: A pipe can be designed using the provisions of this Specification for round HSS as long as the pipe conforms to ASTM A53/A53M Grade B and the appropriate limitations of this Specification are used.

### 3. Gross and Net Area Determination

### 3 a. Gross Area

The gross area,  $ A_{g} $ , of a member is the total cross-sectional area.

### 3 b. Net Area

The net area,  $ A_{n} $ , of a member is the sum of the products of the thickness and the net width of each element computed as follows:

In computing net area for tension and shear, the width of a bolt hole shall be taken as  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) greater than the nominal dimension of the hole.

For a chain of bolt holes extending across a part in any diagonal or zigzag line, the net width of the part shall be obtained by deducting from the gross width the sum of the diameters or slot dimensions as provided in this section, of all holes in the chain, and adding, for each gage space in the chain, the quantity  $ s^{2}/4g $ ,

where

g = transverse center-to-center spacing (gage) between fastener gage lines, in. (mm)

s = longitudinal center-to-center spacing (pitch) of any two consecutive bolt holes, in. (mm)

For angles, the gage for bolt holes in opposite adjacent legs shall be the sum of the gages from the back of the angles less the thickness.

For slotted HSS welded to a gusset plate, the net area,  $ A_{n} $ , is the gross area minus the product of the thickness and the total width of material that is removed to form the slot.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_2.md -->

In determining the net area across plug or slot welds, the weld metal shall not be considered as adding to the net area.

For members without holes, the net area,  $ A_{n} $ , is equal to the gross area,  $ A_{g} $ .

### B5. FABRICATION AND ERECTION

Fabrication, shop painting, and erection shall satisfy the requirements stipulated in Chapter M.

User Note: Code of Standard Practice Section 4 addresses requirements for fabrication and erection documents and Section 4.4 addresses the approval process for approval documents.

### B6. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

Quality control and quality assurance activities shall satisfy the requirements stipulated in Chapter N.

### B7. EVALUATION OF EXISTING STRUCTURES

The evaluation of existing structures shall satisfy the requirements stipulated in Appendix 5.

### B8. DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCES

The provisions in this Specification are based on the assumption that dimensional tolerances provided in the Code of Standard Practice and in the ASTM standards provided in Section A3.1a are satisfied. Where larger tolerances are permitted, the effects of such tolerances shall be considered.

# CHAPTER C DESIGN FOR STABILITY

This chapter addresses requirements for the design of structures for stability. The direct analysis method is presented herein.

The chapter is organized as follows:

C1. General Stability Requirements

C2. Calculation of Required Strengths

C3. Calculation of Available Strengths

User Note: Alternative methods for the design of structures for stability are provided in Appendices 1 and 7. Appendix 1 provides alternatives that allow consideration of member imperfections and/or inelasticity directly within the analysis and provides for a more detailed evaluation of the limit states. Appendix 7 provides the effective length method and a first-order elastic method.

### C1. GENERAL STABILITY REQUIREMENTS

Stability shall be provided for the structure as a whole and for each of its elements. The effects of all of the following on the stability of the structure and its elements shall be considered: (a) flexural, shear, and axial member deformations, and all other component and connection deformations that contribute to the displacements of the structure; (b) second-order effects (including  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects); (c) geometric imperfections; (d) stiffness reductions due to inelasticity, including the effect of partial yielding of the cross section which may be accentuated by the presence of residual stresses; and (e) uncertainty in system, member, and connection strength and stiffness. All load-dependent effects shall be calculated at a level of loading corresponding to LRFD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations.

Any rational method of design for stability that considers all of the listed effects is permitted; this includes the methods identified in Sections C1.1 and C1.2.

User Note: See Commentary Section C1 and Table C-C1.1 for an explanation of how requirements (a) through (e) of Section C1 are satisfied in the methods of design listed in Sections C1.1 and C1.2.

### 1. Direct Analysis Method of Design

The direct analysis method of design is permitted for all structures and can be based on either elastic or inelastic analysis. For design by elastic analysis, required strengths shall be calculated in accordance with Section C2 and the calculation of available strengths in accordance with Section C3. For design by advanced analysis, the provisions of Appendix 1, Section 1.1, and Section 1.2 or 1.3, shall be satisfied.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_4.md -->

### 2. Alternative Methods of Design

The effective length method and the first-order analysis method, both defined in Appendix 7, are based on elastic analysis and are permitted as alternatives to the direct analysis method for structures that satisfy the limitations specified in that appendix.

### C2. CALCULATION OF REQUIRED STRENGTHS

For the direct analysis method of design, the required strengths of components of the structure shall be determined from an elastic analysis conforming to Section C2.1. The analysis shall include consideration of initial imperfections in accordance with Section C2.2 and adjustments to stiffness in accordance with Section C2.3.

### 1. General Analysis Requirements

The analysis of the structure shall conform to the following requirements:

(a) The analysis shall consider flexural, shear, and axial member deformations, and all other component and connection deformations that contribute to displacements of the structure. The analysis shall incorporate reductions in all stiffnesses that are considered to contribute to the stability of the structure, as specified in Section C2.3.

(b) The analysis shall be a second-order analysis that considers both  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects, except that it is permissible to neglect the effect of  $ P-\delta $  on the response of the structure when the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the structure supports gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical columns, walls, or frames; (2) the ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first-order drift (both determined for LRFD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations, with stiffnesses adjusted as specified in Section C2.3) in all stories is equal to or less than 1.7; and (3) no more than one-third of the total gravity load on the structure is supported by columns that are part of moment-resisting frames in the direction of translation being considered. It is necessary in all cases to consider  $ P-\delta $  effects in the evaluation of individual members subjected to compression and flexure.

User Note: A  $ P-\Delta $ -only second-order analysis (one that neglects the effects of  $ P-\delta $  on the response of the structure) is permitted under the conditions listed. In this case, the requirement for considering  $ P-\delta $  effects in the evaluation of individual members can be satisfied by applying the  $ B_{1} $  multiplier defined in Appendix 8, Section 8.1.2, to the required flexural strength of the member.

Use of the approximate method of second-order analysis provided in Appendix 8, Section 8.1, is permitted.

(c) The analysis shall consider all gravity and other applied loads that may influence the stability of the structure.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_5.md -->

User Note: It is important to include in the analysis all gravity loads, including loads on leaning columns and other elements that are not part of the lateral force-resisting system.

(d) For design by LRFD, the second-order analysis shall be carried out under LRFD load combinations. For design by ASD, the second-order analysis shall be carried out under 1.6 times the ASD load combinations, and the results shall be divided by 1.6 to obtain the required strengths of components.

### 2. Consideration of Initial System Imperfections

The effect of initial imperfections in the position of points of intersection of members on the stability of the structure shall be taken into account either by direct modeling of these imperfections in the analysis as specified in Section C2.2a or by the application of notional loads as specified in Section C2.2b.

User Note: The imperfections required to be considered in this section are imperfections in the locations of points of intersection of members (system imperfections). In typical building structures, the important imperfection of this type is the out-of-plumbness of columns. Consideration of initial out-of-straightness of individual members (member imperfections) is not required in the structural analysis when using the provisions of this section; it is accounted for in the compression member design provisions of Chapter E and need not be considered explicitly in the analysis as long as it is within the limits specified in the Code of Standard Practice. Appendix 1, Section 1.2, provides an extension to the direct analysis method that includes modeling of member imperfections (initial out-of-straightness) within the structural analysis.

### 2 a. Direct Modeling of Imperfections

In all cases, it is permissible to account for the effect of initial system imperfections by including the imperfections directly in the analysis. The structure shall be analyzed with points of intersection of members displaced from their nominal locations. The magnitude of the initial displacements shall be the maximum amount considered in the design; the pattern of initial displacements shall be such that it provides the greatest destabilizing effect.

User Note: Initial displacements similar in configuration to both displacements due to loading and anticipated buckling modes should be considered in the modeling of imperfections. The magnitude of the initial displacements should be based on permissible construction tolerances, as specified in the Code of Standard Practice or other governing requirements, or on actual imperfections if known.

In the analysis of structures that support gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical columns, walls, or frames, where the ratio of maximum second-order story drift to maximum first-order story drift (both determined for LRFD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations, with stiffnesses adjusted as specified in Section C2.3) in all stories is equal to or less than 1.7, it is permissible to include

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_6.md -->

initial system imperfections in the analysis for gravity-only load combinations and not in the analysis for load combinations that include applied lateral loads.

### 2 b. Use of Notional Loads to Represent Imperfections

For structures that support gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical columns, walls, or frames, it is permissible to use notional loads to represent the effects of initial system imperfections in the position of points of intersection of members in accordance with the requirements of this section. The notional load shall be applied to a model of the structure based on its nominal geometry.

User Note: In general, the notional load concept is applicable to all types of structures and to imperfections in the positions of both points of intersection of members and points along members, but the specific requirements in Sections C2.2b(a) through C2.2b(d) are applicable only for the particular class of structure and type of system imperfection identified here.

(a) Notional loads shall be applied as lateral loads at all levels. The notional loads shall be additive to other lateral loads and shall be applied in all load combinations, except as indicated in Section C2.2b(d). The magnitude of the notional loads shall be

 $$ N_{i}=0.002\alpha Y_{i} $$ 

where

 $$ \alpha=1.0(LRFD);\alpha=1.6(ASD) $$ 

 $$ N_{i}=notional load applied at level i,kips(N) $$ 

 $ Y_{i} = gravity load applied at level i from the LRFD load combination or ASD load combination, as applicable, kips (N) $ 

User Note: The use of notional loads can lead to additional (generally small) fictitious base shears in the structure. The correct horizontal reactions at the foundation may be obtained by applying an additional horizontal force at the base of the structure, equal and opposite in direction to the sum of all notional loads, distributed among vertical load-carrying elements in the same proportion as the gravity load supported by those elements. The notional loads can also lead to additional overturning effects, which are not fictitious.

(b) The notional load at any level,  $ N_{i} $ , shall be distributed over that level in the same manner as the gravity load at the level. The notional loads shall be applied in the direction that provides the greatest destabilizing effect.

User Note: For most building structures, the requirement regarding notional load direction may be satisfied as follows: for load combinations that do not include lateral loading, consider two alternative orthogonal directions of notional load application, in a positive and a negative sense in each of the two directions, in the same direction at all levels; for load combinations that include lateral loading, apply all notional loads in the direction of the resultant of all lateral loads in the combination.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_7.md -->

(c) The notional load coefficient of 0.002 in Equation C2-1 is based on a nominal initial story out-of-plumbness ratio of 1/500; where the use of a different maximum out-of-plumbness is justified, it is permissible to adjust the notional load coefficient proportionally.

User Note: An out-of-plumbness of 1/500 represents the maximum tolerance on column plumbness specified in the Code of Standard Practice. In some cases, other specified tolerances, such as those on the plan location of columns, will govern and will require a tighter plumbness tolerance.

(d) For structures in which the ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first-order drift (both determined for LRFD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations, with stiffnesses adjusted as specified in Section C2.3) in all stories is equal to or less than 1.7, it is permissible to apply the notional load,  $ N_{i} $ , only in gravity-only load combinations and not in combinations that include other lateral loads.

### 3. Adjustments to Stiffness

The analysis of the structure to determine the required strengths of components shall use reduced stiffnesses, as follows:

(a) A factor of 0.80 shall be applied to all stiffnesses that are considered to contribute to the stability of the structure. It is permissible to apply this reduction factor to all stiffnesses in the structure.

User Note: Applying the stiffness reduction to some members and not others can, in some cases, result in artificial distortion of the structure under load and possible unintended redistribution of forces. This can be avoided by applying the reduction to all members, including those that do not contribute to the stability of the structure.

(b) An additional factor, the stiffness reduction parameter,  $ \tau_{b} $ , shall be applied to the flexural stiffnesses of all members whose flexural stiffnesses are considered to contribute to the stability of the structure. For noncomposite members,  $ \tau_{b} $  shall be defined as follows (see Section I1.5 for the definition of  $ \tau_{b} $  for composite members):

(1) When  $ \alpha P_{r}/P_{ns} \leq 0.5 $ 

 $$ \tau_{b}=1.0 $$ 

(2) When  $ \alpha P_{r}/P_{ns} > 0.5 $ 

 $$ \tau_{b}=4\big(\alpha P_{r}/P_{n s}\big)\big[1-\big(\alpha P_{r}/P_{n s}\big)\big] $$ 

where

 $$ \alpha_{ 冮 }=1.0(LRFD);\alpha_{ 冮 }=1.6(ASD) $$ 

 $ P_{r} $  = required axial compressive strength using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kips (N)

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_8.md -->

 $ P_{ns}= $  cross-section compressive strength; for nonslender-element sections,  $ P_{ns}=F_{y}A_{g} $ , and for slender-element sections,  $ P_{ns}=F_{y}A_{e} $ , where  $ A_{e} $  is as defined in Section E7 with  $ F_{n}=F_{y} $ , kips (N)

User Note: Taken together, Sections (a) and (b) require the use of  $ 0.8\tau_{b} $  times the nominal elastic flexural stiffness and 0.8 times other nominal elastic stiffnesses for structural steel members in the analysis.

(c) In structures to which Section C2.2b is applicable, in lieu of using  $ \tau_{b}<1.0 $ , where  $ \alpha P_{r}/P_{ns}>0.5 $ , it is permissible to use  $ \tau_{b}=1.0 $  for all noncomposite members if a notional load of  $ 0.001\alpha Y_{i} $  [where  $ Y_{i} $  is as defined in Section C2.2b(a)] is applied at all levels, in the direction specified in Section C2.2b(b), in all load combinations. These notional loads shall be added to those, if any, used to account for the effects of initial imperfections in the position of points of intersection of members and shall not be subject to the provisions of Section C2.2b(d).

(d) Where components composed of materials other than structural steel are considered to contribute to the stability of the structure, and the governing codes and specifications for the other materials require greater reductions in stiffness, such greater stiffness reductions shall be applied to those components.

### C3. CALCULATION OF AVAILABLE STRENGTHS

For the direct analysis method of design, the available strengths of members and connections shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapters D through K, as applicable, with no further consideration of overall structure stability. The effective length for flexural buckling of all members shall be taken as the unbraced length unless a smaller value is justified by rational analysis.

Bracing intended to define the unbraced lengths of members shall have sufficient stiffness and strength to control member movement at the braced points.

User Note: Methods of satisfying this bracing requirement are provided in Appendix 6. The requirements of Appendix 6 are not applicable to bracing that is included in the design of the lateral force-resisting system of the overall structure.

# CHAPTER D DESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR TENSION

This chapter applies to members subjected to axial tension.

The chapter is organized as follows:

D1. Slenderness Limitations

D2. Tensile Strength

D3. Effective Net Area

D4. Built-Up Members

D5. Pin-Connected Members

D6. Eyebars

User Note: For cases not included in this chapter, the following sections apply:

• B3.11 Members subjected to fatigue

• Chapter H Members subjected to combined axial tension and flexure

• J3 Threaded rods

• J4.1 Connecting elements in tension

• J4.3 Block shear rupture strength at end connections of tension members

### D1. SLENDERNESS LIMITATIONS

There is no maximum slenderness limit for members in tension.

User Note: For members designed on the basis of tension, the slenderness ratio of the member as fabricated—taken as the fabricated length of the member divided by the least radius of gyration of the section—preferably should not exceed 300\. This suggestion does not apply to rods.

### D2. TENSILE STRENGTH

The design tensile strength,  $ \phi_{t}P_{n} $ , and the allowable tensile strength,  $ P_{n}/\Omega_{t} $ , of tension members shall be the lower value obtained according to the limit states of tensile yielding in the gross section and tensile rupture in the net section.

(a) For tensile yielding

 $$ \begin{aligned}&P_{n}=F_{y}A_{g}\\ &\phi_{t}=0.90(LRFD)\qquad\Omega_{t}=1.67(ASD)\\ \end{aligned} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_10.md -->

(b) For tensile rupture

 $$ P_{n}=F_{u}A_{e} $$ 

 $$ \phi_{t}=0.75(LRFD)\qquad\Omega_{t}=2.00(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ A_{e}= $  effective net area, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

 $ A_{g}= $  gross area of member, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

 $ F_{y} $  = specified minimum yield stress, ksi (MPa)



 $ F_{u} $  = specified minimum tensile strength, ksi (MPa)

Where connections use plug, slot, or fillet welds in holes or slots, the effective net area through the holes shall be used in Equation D2-2.

### D3. EFFECTIVE NET AREA

The gross area,  $ A_{g} $ , and net area,  $ A_{n} $ , of tension members shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section B4.3.

The effective net area of tension members shall be determined as

 $$ A_{e}=A_{n}U $$ 

where U, the shear lag factor, is determined as shown in Table D3.1.

For open cross sections such as W, M, S, C, or HP shapes, WTs, STs, and single and double angles, the shear lag factor, U, need not be less than the ratio of the gross area of the connected element(s) to the member gross area. This provision does not apply to closed sections, such as HSS, nor to plates.

### D4. BUILT-UP MEMBERS

For limitations on the longitudinal spacing of connectors between elements in continuous contact consisting of a plate and a shape, or two plates, see Section J3.6.

Lacing, perforated cover plates, or tie plates without lacing are permitted to be used on the open sides of built-up tension members. Tie plates shall have a length not less than two-thirds the distance between the lines of welds or fasteners connecting them to the components of the member. The thickness of such tie plates shall not be less than one-fiftieth of the distance between these lines. The longitudinal spacing of intermittent welds or fasteners at tie plates shall not exceed 6 in. (150 mm).

User Note: The longitudinal spacing of connectors between components should preferably limit the slenderness ratio in any component between the connectors to 300.

### E2. EFFECTIVE LENGTH

The effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , for calculation of member slenderness,  $ L_{c}/r $ , shall be determined in accordance with Chapter C or Appendix 7,

where

 $ L_{c}= $  effective length of member, in. (mm)

 $$ =KL $$ 

K = effective length factor

L = laterally unbraced length of the member, in. (mm)

 $$ r = \text{radius of gyration, in. (mm)} $$ 

User Note: For members designed on the basis of compression, the effective slenderness ratio,  $ L_{c}/r $ , preferably should not exceed 200. Furthermore, the slenderness ratio of the member as fabricated—taken as the fabricated length of the member divided by the least radius of gyration of the section—preferably should not exceed 300.

User Note: The effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , may be determined using an effective length factor, K, or a buckling analysis.

### E3. FLEXURAL BUCKLING OF MEMBERS WITHOUT SLENDER ELEMENTS

This section applies to nonslender-element compression members, as defined in Section B4.1, for elements in axial compression.

User Note: When the torsional effective length is larger than the lateral effective length, Section E4 may control.

The nominal compressive strength,  $ P_{n} $ , shall be determined based on the limit state of flexural buckling:

 $$ P_{n}=F_{n}A_{g} $$ 

The nominal stress,  $ F_{n} $ , is determined as follows:

 $$  (a)\ When\frac{L_{c}}{r}\leq4.71\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}}\quad(or\frac{F_{y}}{F_{e}}\leq2.25) $$ 

 $$ F_{n}=\left(0.658^{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{e}}}\right)F_{y} $$

### E4. TORSIONAL AND FLEXURAL-TORSIONAL BUCKLING OF SINGLE ANGLES AND MEMBERS WITHOUT SLENDER ELEMENTS

This section applies to singly symmetric and unsymmetric members, certain doubly symmetric members, such as cruciform or built-up members, and doubly symmetric members when the torsional unbraced length exceeds the lateral unbraced length, all without slender elements. These provisions also apply to single angles with  $ b/t > 0.71\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , where b is the width of the longest leg and t is the thickness.

The nominal compressive strength,  $ P_{n} $ , shall be determined based on the limit states of torsional and flexural-torsional buckling:

 $$ P_{n}=F_{n}A_{g} $$ 

The nominal stress,  $ F_{n} $ , shall be determined according to Equation E3-2 or E3-3, using the torsional or flexural-torsional elastic buckling stress,  $ F_{e} $ , determined as follows:

(a) For doubly symmetric members twisting about the shear center

 $$ F_{e}=\left(\frac{\pi^{2}EC_{w}}{{L_{cz}}^{2}}+GJ\right)\frac{1}{I_{x}+I_{y}} $$ 

(b) For singly symmetric members twisting about the shear center where y is the axis of symmetry

 $$ F_{e}=\left(\frac{F_{ey}+F_{ez}}{2H}\right)\left[1-\sqrt{1-\frac{4F_{ey}F_{ez}H}{\left(F_{ey}+F_{ez}\right)^{2}}}\right] $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_19.md -->

User Note: For singly symmetric members with the x-axis as the axis of symmetry, such as channels, Equation E4-3 is applicable with  $ F_{ey} $  replaced by  $ F_{ex} $ .

(c) For unsymmetric members twisting about the shear center,  $ F_{e} $  is the lowest root of the cubic equation

 $$ \Big(F_{e}-F_{ex}\Big)\Big(F_{e}-F_{ey}\Big)\Big(F_{e}-F_{ez}\Big)-F_{e}^{2}\Big(F_{e}-F_{ey}\Big)\Bigg(\frac{x_{o}}{\overline{r}_{o}}\Bigg)^{2}-F_{e}^{2}\Big(F_{e}-F_{ex}\Big)\Bigg(\frac{y_{o}}{\overline{r}_{o}}\Bigg)^{2}=0 $$

(f) For all other members with lateral bracing offset from the shear center, the elastic buckling stress,  $ F_{e} $ , shall be determined by analysis.

User Note: Bracing offset from the shear center is often referred to as constrained-axis torsional buckling and is discussed further in the Commentary. Members that buckle in this mode will exhibit twisting because the braces restrain only lateral movement.

### E5. SINGLE-ANGLE COMPRESSION MEMBERS

The nominal compressive strength,  $ P_{n} $ , of single-angle members shall be the lowest value based on the limit states of flexural buckling in accordance with Section E3 or Section E7, as applicable, or flexural-torsional buckling in accordance with Section E4. Flexural-torsional buckling need not be considered when  $ b/t \leq 0.71 \sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ .

The effects of eccentricity on single-angle members are permitted to be neglected and the member evaluated as axially loaded using one of the effective slenderness ratios specified in Section E5(a) or E5(b), provided that the following requirements are met:

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_21.md -->

(1) Members are loaded at the ends in compression through the same one leg.

(2) Members are attached by welding or by connections with a minimum of two bolts.

(3) There are no intermediate transverse loads.

(4)  $ L_{c}/r $  as determined in this section does not exceed 200.

(5) For unequal leg angles, the ratio of long leg width to short leg width is less than 1.7.

Single-angle members that do not meet these requirements or the requirements described in Section E5(a) or (b) shall be evaluated for combined axial load and flexure using the provisions of Chapter H.

(a) For angles that are individual members or are web members of planar trusses with adjacent web members attached to the same side of the gusset plate or chord

(1) For equal-leg angles or unequal-leg angles connected through the longer leg

(i) When  $ \frac{L}{r_{a}} \leq 80 $ 

 $$ \frac{L_{c}}{r}=72+0.75\frac{L}{r_{a}} $$ 

(ii) When  $ \frac{L}{r_{a}} > 80 $ 

 $$ \frac{L_{c}}{r}=32+1.25\frac{L}{r_{a}} $$ 

(2) For unequal-leg angles connected through the shorter leg,  $ L_{c}/r $  from Equations E5-1 and E5-2 shall be increased by adding  $ 4\left[\left(b_{l}/b_{s}\right)^{2}-1\right] $ , but  $ L_{c}/r $  of the members shall not be taken as less than  $ 0.95L/r_{z} $ .

(b) For angles that are web members of box or space trusses with adjacent web members attached to the same side of the gusset plate or chord

(1) For equal-leg angles or unequal-leg angles connected through the longer leg

(ii) When  $ \frac{L}{r_{a}} > 75 $

### E6. BUILT-UP MEMBERS

### 1. Compressive Strength

This section applies to built-up members composed of two shapes either (a) interconnected by bolts or welds or (b) with at least one open side interconnected by perforated cover plates or lacing with tie plates. The end connection shall be welded or connected by means of pretensioned bolts with Class A or B faying surfaces.

User Note: It is acceptable to design a bolted end connection of a built-up compression member for the full compressive load with bolts in bearing and bolt design based on the shear strength; however, the bolts must be pretensioned. In built-up compression members, such as double-angle struts in trusses, a small relative slip between the elements can significantly reduce the compressive strength of the strut. Therefore, the connection between the elements at the ends of built-up members should be designed to resist slip.

The nominal compressive strength of built-up members composed of two shapes that are interconnected by bolts or welds shall be determined in accordance with Sections E3, E4, or E7, subject to the following modification. In lieu of more accurate analysis, if the buckling mode involves relative deformations that produce shear forces in the connectors between individual shapes,  $ L_{c}/r $  is replaced by  $ \left(L_{c}/r\right)_{m} $ , determined as follows:

(a) For intermediate connectors that are bolted snug-tight

 $$ \left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{m}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{o}^{2}+\left(\frac{a}{r_{i}}\right)^{2}} $$ 

(b) For intermediate connectors that are welded or are connected by means of pretensioned bolts with Class A or B faying surfaces

(1) When  $ \frac{a}{r_{i}} \leq 40 $ 

 $$ \left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{m}=\left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{o} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_23.md -->

(2) When  $ \frac{a}{r_{i}} > 40 $ 

 $$ \left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{m}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{o}^{2}+\left(\frac{K_{i}a}{r_{i}}\right)^{2}} $$ 

where

 $$ \left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{m}=\text{modified slenderness ratio of built-up member} $$ 

 $$ \left(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\right)_{o}=\operatorname{slenderness ratio of built-up member acting as a unit in the buckling direction being addressed} $$ 

 $$ L_{c}=effective length of built-up member,in.(mm) $$ 

 $$ K_{i}=0.50 for angles back-to-back $$ 

= 0.75 for channels back-to-back

= 0.86 for all other cases

a = distance between connectors, in. (mm)

 $$ r_{i}=\text{minimum radius of gyration of individual component, in. (mm)} $$ 

### 2. General Requirements

Built-up members shall meet the following requirements:

(a) Individual components of compression members composed of two or more shapes shall be connected to one another at intervals, a, such that the slenderness ratio,  $ a/r_{i} $ , of each of the component shapes between the fasteners does not exceed three-fourths times the governing slenderness ratio of the built-up member. The minimum radius of gyration,  $ r_{i} $ , shall be used in computing the slenderness ratio of each component part.

(b) At the ends of built-up compression members bearing on base plates or finished surfaces, all components in contact with one another shall be connected by a weld having a length not less than the maximum width of the member or by bolts spaced longitudinally not more than four diameters apart for a distance equal to  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  times the maximum width of the member.

Along the length of built-up compression members between the end connections required in the foregoing, longitudinal spacing of intermittent welds or bolts shall be adequate to provide the required strength. For limitations on the longitudinal spacing of fasteners between elements in continuous contact consisting of a plate and a shape, or two plates, see Section J3.6. Where a component of a built-up compression member consists of an outside plate, the maximum spacing shall not exceed the thickness of the thinner outside plate times  $ 0.75\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  nor 12 in. (300 mm), when intermittent welds are provided along the edges of the components or when fasteners are provided on all gage lines at each section. When fasteners are staggered, the maximum spacing of fasteners on each gage line shall not exceed the thickness of the thinner outside plate times  $ 1.12\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  nor 18 in. (450 mm).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_24.md -->

(c) Open sides of compression members built up from plates or shapes shall be provided with continuous cover plates perforated with a succession of access openings. The unsupported width of such plates at access openings, as defined in Section B4.1, is assumed to contribute to the available strength provided the following requirements are met:

(1) The width-to-thickness ratio shall conform to the limitations of Section B4.1.

User Note: It is conservative to use the limiting width-to-thickness ratio for Case 7 in Table B4.1a with the width, b, taken as the transverse distance between the nearest lines of fasteners. The net area of the plate is taken at the widest hole. In lieu of this approach, the limiting width-to-thickness ratio may be determined through analysis.

(2) The ratio of length (in direction of stress) to width of hole shall not exceed 2.

(3) The clear distance between holes in the direction of stress shall be not less than the transverse distance between nearest lines of connecting fasteners or welds.

(4) The periphery of the holes at all points shall have a minimum radius of  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm).

(d) As an alternative to perforated cover plates, lacing with tie plates is permitted at each end and at intermediate points if the lacing is interrupted. Tie plates shall be as near the ends as practicable. In members providing available strength, the end tie plates shall have a length of not less than the distance between the lines of fasteners or welds connecting them to the components of the member. Intermediate tie plates shall have a length not less than one-half of this distance. The thickness of tie plates shall be not less than one-fiftieth of the distance between lines of welds or fasteners connecting them to the segments of the members. In welded construction, the welding on each line connecting a tie plate shall total not less than one-third the length of the plate. In bolted construction, the spacing in the direction of stress in tie plates shall be not more than six diameters and the tie plates shall be connected to each segment by at least three fasteners.

(e) Lacing, including flat bars, angles, channels, or other shapes employed as lacing, shall be so spaced that L/r of the flange element included between their connections shall not exceed three-fourths times the governing slenderness ratio for the member as a whole. Lacing shall be proportioned to provide a shearing strength normal to the axis of the member equal to 2% of the available compressive strength of the member. For lacing bars arranged in single systems, L/r shall not exceed 140. For double lacing, this ratio shall not exceed 200. Double lacing bars shall be joined at the intersections. For lacing bars in compression, L is permitted to be taken as the unsupported length of the lacing bar between welds or fasteners connecting it to the components of the built-up member for single lacing, and 70% of that distance for double lacing.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_4/doc_25.md -->

User Note: The inclination of lacing bars to the axis of the member shall preferably be not less than  $ 60^{\circ} $  for single lacing and  $ 45^{\circ} $  for double lacing. When the distance between the lines of welds or fasteners in the flanges is more than 15 in. (380 mm), the lacing should preferably be double or made of angles.

For additional spacing requirements, see Section J3.6.

### E7. MEMBERS WITH SLENDER ELEMENTS

This section applies to slender-element compression members, as defined in Section B4.1 for elements in axial compression.

The nominal compressive strength,  $ P_{n} $ , shall be the lowest value based on the applicable limit states of flexural buckling, torsional buckling, and flexural-torsional buckling in interaction with local buckling.

 $$ P_{n}=F_{n}A_{e} $$ 

where

$A_{e} = \text{summation of the effective areas of the cross section based on reduced effective widths}, b_{e}, d_{e}, \text{or } h_{e}, \text{ or the area as given by Equation E7-6 or E7-7, in.}^{2} (\text{mm}^{2})$

 $ F_{n}= $  nominal stress determined in accordance with Section E3 or E4, ksi (MPa). For single angles, determine  $ F_{n} $  in accordance with Section E3 only.

User Note: The effective area,  $ A_{e} $ , may be determined by deducting from the gross area,  $ A_{g} $ , the reduction in area of each slender element determined as  $ (b - b_{e})t $ .

### 1. Slender Element Members Excluding Round HSS

 $$ b_{e}=b\Biggl(1-c_{l}\sqrt{\frac{F_{el}}{F_{n}}}\Biggr)\sqrt{\frac{F_{el}}{F_{n}}} $$ 

where

b = width of the element (for tees this is d; for webs this is h), in. (mm)

 $$ c_{1}=effective width imperfection adjustment factor determined from Table E7.1 $$

The effective area,  $ A_{e} $ , is determined as follows:

(a) When  $ \frac{D}{t} \leq 0.11\frac{E}{F_{y}} $

### F1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

The design flexural strength, $\phi_{b}M_{n}$, and the allowable flexural strength, $M_{n}/\Omega_{b}$, shall be determined as follows:

(a) For all provisions in this chapter

 $$ \phi_{b}=0.90(LRFD)\qquad\Omega_{b}=1.67(ASD) $$ 

and the nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , shall be determined according to Sections F2 through F13.

(b) The provisions in this chapter are based on the assumption that points of support for beams and girders are restrained against rotation about their longitudinal axis.

(c) For singly symmetric members in single curvature and all doubly symmetric members

The lateral-torsional buckling modification factor,  $ C_{b} $ , for nonuniform moment diagrams when both ends of the segment are braced is determined as follows:

 $$ C_{b}=\frac{12.5M_{max}}{2.5M_{max}+3M_{A}+4M_{B}+3M_{C}} $$ 

where

 $ M_{max} $  = absolute value of maximum moment in the unbraced segment, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{A} $  = absolute value of moment at quarter point of the unbraced segment,

kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{B} $  = absolute value of moment at centerline of the unbraced segment, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{C} $  = absolute value of moment at three-quarter point of the unbraced segment, kip-in. (N-mm)

User Note: For doubly symmetric members with no transverse loading between brace points, Equation F1-1 reduces to 1.0 for the case of equal end moments of opposite sign (uniform moment), 2.27 for the case of equal end moments of the same sign (reverse curvature bending), and to 1.67 when one end moment equals zero. For singly symmetric members, a more detailed analysis for  $ C_{b} $  is presented in the Commentary. The Commentary provides additional equations for  $ C_{b} $  that provide improved characterization of the effects of a variety of member boundary conditions.

For cantilevers where warping is prevented at the support and where the free end is unbraced,  $ C_{b} = 1.0 $ .

(d) In singly symmetric members subjected to reverse curvature bending, the lateral-torsional buckling strength shall be checked for both flanges. The available flexural strength shall be greater than or equal to the maximum required moment causing compression within the flange under consideration.

### F2. DOUBLY SYMMETRIC COMPACT I-SHAPED MEMBERS AND CHANNELS BENT ABOUT THEIR MAJOR AXIS

This section applies to doubly symmetric I-shaped members and channels bent about their major axis, having compact webs and compact flanges as defined in Section B4.1 for flexure.

For  $ F_{y}\leq70 $  ksi (485 MPa), all current ASTM A6/A6M W, S, M, HP, C, and MC shapes have compact webs.

The nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , shall be the lower value obtained according to the limit states of yielding (plastic moment) and lateral-torsional buckling.

### 1. Yielding

 $$ M_{n}=M_{p}=F_{y}Z_{x} $$ 

where

 $ F_{y} $  = specified minimum yield stress of the type of steel being used, ksi (MPa)

 $ Z_{x} $  = plastic section modulus about the x-axis, in. $ ^{3} $  (mm $ ^{3} $ )

### 2. Lateral-Torsional Buckling

(a) When  $ L_{b} \leq L_{p} $ , the limit state of lateral-torsional buckling does not apply.

(b) When  $ L_{p} < L_{b} \leq L_{r} $ 

 $$ M_{n}=C_{b}\Biggl[M_{p}\ -\Big(M_{p}\ -0.7F_{y}S_{x}\Biggr)\Biggl(\frac{L_{b}-L_{p}}{L_{r}-L_{p}}\Biggr)\Biggr]\leq M_{p} $$ 

(c) When  $ L_{b} > L_{r} $

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_5/doc_1.md -->

User Note: The square root term in Equation F2-4 may be conservatively taken as equal to 1.0.

User Note: Equations F2-3 and F2-4 provide identical solutions to the following expression for lateral-torsional buckling of doubly symmetric members that has been presented in past editions of this Specification:

 $$ M_{cr}=C_{b}\frac{\pi}{L_{b}}\sqrt{EI_{y}GJ+\left(\frac{\pi E}{L_{b}}\right)^{2}I_{y}C_{w}} $$ 

The advantage of Equations F2-3 and F2-4 is that the form is very similar to the expression for lateral-torsional buckling of singly symmetric I-shaped members given in Equations F4-3 and F4-5.

 $ L_{p} $ , the limiting laterally unbraced length for the limit state of yielding, in. (mm), is

 $$ L_{p}=1.76r_{y}\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}} $$ 

 $ L_{r} $ , the limiting unbraced length for the limit state of inelastic lateral-torsional buckling, in. (mm), is

 $$ L_{r}=1.95r_{ts}\frac{E}{0.7F_{y}}\sqrt{\frac{Jc}{S_{x}h_{o}}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{Jc}{S_{x}h_{o}}\right)^{2}+6.76\left(\frac{0.7F_{y}}{E}\right)^{2}}} $$ 

where

$r_{y} = \mathrm{radius}$ of gyration about y-axis, in. (mm)

 $$ r_{ts}^{2}=\frac{\sqrt{I_{y}C_{w}}}{S_{x}} $$ 

and the coefficient c is determined as follows:

(1) For doubly symmetric I-shapes

 $$ c=1 $$ 

(2) For channels

 $$ c=\frac{h_{o}}{2}\sqrt{\frac{I_{y}}{C_{w}}} $$ 

where

 $ I_{y}= $  moment of inertia about the y-axis, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

## User Note:

For doubly symmetric I-shapes with rectangular flanges,  $ C_{w}=\frac{I_{y}h_{o}^{2}}{4} $ , and, thus, Equation F2-7 becomes

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_5/doc_2.md -->

 $$ r_{ts}^{2}=\frac{I_{y}h_{o}}{2S_{x}} $$ 

 $ r_{ts} $  may be approximated accurately to conservatively as the radius of gyration of the compression flange plus one-sixth of the web:

 $$ r_{ts}=\frac{b_{f}}{\sqrt{12\left(1+\frac{1}{6}\frac{ht_{w}}{b_{f}t_{f}}\right)}} $$

### 4. Transverse Stiffeners

For transverse stiffeners, the following shall apply.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_5/doc_26.md -->

(a) Transverse stiffeners are not required where  $ h/t_{w} \leq 2.54 \sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , or where the available shear strength provided in accordance with Section G2.1 for  $ k_{v} = 5.34 $  is greater than the required shear strength.

where

 $$ F_{yst}=specified minimum yield stress of the stiffener material,ksi(MPa) $$ 

 $ I_{st} $  = moment of inertia of the transverse stiffeners about an axis in the web center for stiffener pairs, or about the face in contact with the web plate for single stiffeners, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

Equation G2-18 provides the minimum stiffener moment of inertia required to attain the web shear post-buckling resistance according to Sections G2.1 and G2.2, as applicable.

t = design wall thickness, in. (mm)

User Note: The shear buckling equations, Equations G5-2a and G5-2b, will control for D/t over 100, high-strength steels, and long lengths. For standard sections, shear yielding will usually control and  $ F_{cr}=0.6F_{y} $ .

# CHAPTER I DESIGN OF COMPOSITE MEMBERS

This chapter addresses composite members composed of rolled or built-up structural steel shapes or HSS and structural concrete acting together, and steel beams supporting a reinforced concrete slab so interconnected that the beams and the slab act together to resist bending. Simple and continuous composite beams with steel headed stud anchors, and encased and filled beams, constructed with or without temporary shores, are included. This chapter also addresses concrete filled composite plate shear walls composed of structural steel plates, ties, steel anchors, and structural concrete acting together.

The chapter is organized as follows:

II. General Provisions

I2. Axial Force

I3. Flexure

I4. Shear

I5. Combined Flexure and Axial Force

I6. Load Transfer

I7. Composite Diaphragms and Collector Beams

I8. Steel Anchors

### I 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

In determining load effects in members and connections of a structure that includes composite members, consideration shall be given to the effective cross sections at the time each increment of load is applied.

### 1. Concrete and Steel Reinforcement

The design, detailing, and material properties related to the concrete and reinforcing steel portions of composite construction shall comply with the reinforced concrete design specifications stipulated by the applicable building code. Additionally, the provisions in the Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318) and the Metric Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318M), subsequently referred to in Chapter I collectively as ACI 318, shall apply with the following exceptions and limitations:

(a) Concrete and steel reinforcement material limitations shall be as specified in Section I1.3.

(b) Longitudinal and transverse reinforcement requirements shall be as specified in Sections I2 and I3 in addition to those specified in ACI 318.

Concrete and steel reinforcement components designed in accordance with ACI 318 shall be based on a level of loading corresponding to LRFD load combinations.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_6/doc_7.md -->

User Note: It is the intent of this Specification that the concrete and reinforcing steel portions of composite concrete members are designed and detailed utilizing the provisions of ACI 318 as modified by this Specification. All requirements specific to composite members are covered in this Specification.

Note that the design basis for ACI 318 is strength design. Designers using ASD for steel must be conscious of the different load factors.

### 2. Nominal Strength of Composite Sections

The nominal strength of composite sections shall be determined in accordance with either the plastic stress distribution method, the strain compatibility method, the elastic stress distribution method, or the effective stress-strain method, as defined in this section.

The tensile strength of the concrete shall be neglected in the determination of the nominal strength of composite members.

Local buckling effects shall be evaluated for filled composite members, as defined in Section I1.4. Local buckling effects need not be evaluated for encased composite members or composite plate shear walls meeting the requirements of this chapter.

### 2 a. Plastic Stress Distribution Method

For the plastic stress distribution method, the nominal strength shall be computed assuming that steel components have reached a stress of  $ F_{y} $  in either tension or compression, and concrete components in compression due to axial force and/or flexure have reached a stress of  $ 0.85f_{c}^{\prime} $ , where  $ f_{c}^{\prime} $  is the specified compressive strength of concrete, ksi (MPa). For round HSS filled with concrete, a stress of  $ 0.95f_{c}^{\prime} $  is permitted to be used for concrete components in compression due to axial force and/or flexure to account for the effects of concrete confinement.

### 2 b. Strain Compatibility Method

For the strain compatibility method, a linear distribution of strains across the section shall be assumed, with the maximum concrete compressive strain equal to 0.003 in./in. (mm/mm). The stress-strain relationships for steel and concrete shall be obtained from tests or from published results.

User Note: The strain compatibility method can be used to determine nominal strength for irregular sections and for cases where the steel does not exhibit elastoplastic behavior. General guidelines for the strain compatibility method for encased members subjected to axial load, flexure, or both are given in AISC Design Guide 6, Load and Resistance Factor Design of W-Shapes Encased in Concrete.

### 2 c. Elastic Stress Distribution Method

For the elastic stress distribution method, the nominal strength shall be determined from the superposition of elastic stresses for the limit state of yielding or concrete crushing.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_6/doc_8.md -->

### 2 d. Effective Stress-Strain Method

For the effective stress-strain method, the nominal strength shall be computed assuming strain compatibility and effective stress-strain relationships for structural steel, reinforcing steel, and concrete components accounting for the effects of local buckling, yielding, interaction, and concrete confinement.

### 3. Material Limitations

For concrete, structural steel, and reinforcing steel in composite systems, the following limitations shall be met unless the design is based on the requirements of Appendix 2:

(a) For the determination of the available strength, concrete shall have a specified compressive strength,  $ f_{c}^{\prime} $ , of not less than 3 ksi (21 MPa) nor more than 10 ksi (69 MPa) for normal weight concrete and not less than 3 ksi (21 MPa) nor more than 6 ksi (41 MPa) for lightweight concrete.

(b) The specified minimum yield stress of structural steel used in calculating the strength of composite members shall not exceed 75 ksi (525 MPa).

(c) The specified minimum yield stress of reinforcing bars used in calculating the strength of composite members shall not exceed 80 ksi (550 MPa).

The design of filled composite members constructed from materials with strengths above the limits noted in this section shall be in accordance with Appendix 2.

User Note: Appendix 2 includes equations for determining the available strength of rectangular filled composite members with either the specified minimum yield stress of structural steel exceeding 75 ksi (525 MPa) but less than 100 ksi (690 MPa) or specified compressive strength,  $ f_{c}^{\prime} $ , exceeding 10 ksi (69 MPa) but less than 15 ksi (100 MPa).

### 4. Classification of Filled Composite Sections for Local Buckling

For compression, filled composite sections are classified as compact composite, non-compact composite, or slender-element composite sections. For a section to qualify as compact composite, the maximum width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda $ , of its compression steel elements shall not exceed the limiting width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda_{p} $ , from Table I1.1a. If the maximum width-to-thickness ratio of one or more steel compression elements exceeds  $ \lambda_{p} $ , but does not exceed  $ \lambda_{r} $  from Table I1.1a, the filled composite section is noncompact composite. If the maximum width-to-thickness ratio of any compression steel element exceeds  $ \lambda_{r} $ , the section is slender-element composite. The maximum permitted width-to-thickness ratio shall be as specified in Table I1.1a.

For flexure, filled composite sections are classified as compact composite, noncompact composite, or slender-element composite sections. For a section to qualify as compact composite, the maximum width-to-thickness ratio of its compression steel elements shall not exceed the limiting width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda_{p} $ , from Table II.1b.

When tensile forces due to applied tension or flexure are to be transmitted through splices in heavy shapes, as defined in Sections A3.1d and A3.1e, by complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove welds, the following provisions apply: (a) material notch-toughness requirements as given in Sections A3.1d and A3.1e; (b) weld access hole details as given in Section J1.6; (c) filler metal requirements as given in Section J2.6; and (d) thermal cut surface preparation and inspection requirements as given in Section M2.2. The foregoing provision is not applicable to splices of elements of built-up shapes that are welded prior to assembling the shape.

User Note: CJP groove welded splices of heavy sections can exhibit detrimental effects of weld shrinkage. Members that are sized for compression that are also subjected to tensile forces may be less susceptible to damage from shrinkage if they are spliced using partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welds on the flanges and fillet-welded web plates, or using bolts for some or all of the splice.

### 6. Weld Access Holes

Weld access holes shall meet the following requirements:

(a) All weld access holes required to facilitate welding operations shall be detailed to provide room for weld backing as needed.

(b) The access hole shall have a length from the toe of the weld preparation not less than  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  times the thickness of the material in which the hole is made, nor less than  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm).

(c) The access hole shall have a height not less than the thickness of the material with the access hole, nor less than  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm), nor does it need to exceed 2 in. (50 mm).

(d) For sections that are rolled or welded prior to cutting, the edge of the web shall be sloped or curved from the surface of the flange to the reentrant surface of the access hole.

(e) In hot-rolled shapes, and built-up shapes with CJP groove welds that join the web-to-flange, weld access holes shall be free of notches and sharp reentrant corners.

(f) No arc of the weld access hole shall have a radius less than  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm).

(g) In built-up shapes with fillet or partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welds that join the web-to-flange, weld access holes shall be free of notches and sharp reentrant corners.

(h) The access hole is permitted to terminate perpendicular to the flange, providing the weld is terminated at least a distance equal to the weld size away from the access hole.

(i) For heavy shapes, as defined in Sections A3.1d and A3.1e, the thermally cut surfaces of weld access holes shall be ground to bright metal.

(j) If the curved transition portion of weld access holes is formed by predrilled or sawed holes, that portion of the access hole need not be ground.

### 7. Placement of Welds and Bolts

Groups of welds or bolts at the ends of any member that transmit axial force into that member shall be sized so that the center of gravity of the group coincides with the center of gravity of the member, unless provision is made for the eccentricity. The foregoing provision is not applicable to end connections of single-angle, double-angle, and similar members.

### 8. Bolts in Combination with Welds

Bolts shall not be considered as sharing the load in combination with welds, except in the design of shear connections on a common faying surface where strain compatibility between the bolts and welds is considered.

It is permitted to determine the available strength,  $ \phi R_{n} $  and  $ R_{n}/\Omega $ , as applicable, of a joint combining the strengths of high-strength bolts and longitudinal fillet welds as

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_7/doc_11.md -->

the sum of (1) the nominal slip resistance,  $ R_{n} $ , for bolts as defined in Equation J3-4 according to the requirements of a slip-critical connection and (2) the nominal weld strength,  $ R_{n} $ , as defined in Section J2.4, when the following apply:

(a)  $ \phi = 0.75 $  (LRFD);  $ \Omega = 2.00 $  (ASD) for the combined joint.

(b) When the high-strength bolts are pretensioned according to the requirements of Table J3.1 or Table J3.1M using the turn-of-nut or combined method, the longitudinal fillet welds shall have an available strength of not less than 50% of the required strength of the connection.

(c) When the high-strength bolts are pretensioned according to the requirements of Table J3.1 or Table J3.1M using any method other than the turn-of-nut method, the longitudinal fillet welds shall have an available strength of not less than 70% of the required strength of the connection.

(d) The high-strength bolts shall have an available strength of not less than 33% of the required strength of the connection.

In joints with combined bolts and longitudinal welds, the strength of the connection need not be taken as less than either the strength of the bolts alone or the strength of the welds alone.

### 9. Welded Alterations to Structures with Existing Rivets or Bolts

In making welded alterations to structures, existing rivets and high-strength bolts in standard or short-slotted holes transverse to the direction of load, and tightened to the requirements of slip-critical connections are permitted to be utilized for resisting loads present at the time of alteration, and the welding need only provide the additional required strength. The weld available strength shall provide the additional required strength, but not less than 25% of the required strength of the connection.

User Note: The provisions of this section are generally recommended for alteration in building designs or for field corrections. Use of the combined strength of bolts and welds on a common faying surface is not recommended for new design.

### 10. High-Strength Bolts in Combination with Existing Rivets

In connections designed as slip-critical connections in accordance with the provisions of Section J3, high-strength bolts are permitted to be considered as sharing the load with existing rivets.

### J2. WELDS AND WELDED JOINTS

Welding shall conform to the provisions of the Structural Welding Code—Steel (AWS D1.1/D1.1M), hereafter referred to as AWS D1.1/D1.1M, except where those provisions differ from this Specification. This Specification governs where provisions differ from AWS D1.1/D1.1M.

User Note: Examples of provisions in AWS D1.1/D1.1M that differ from the Specification provisions are shown in the Commentary.

### 1. Groove Welds

### 1 a. Effective Area

The effective area of groove welds shall be taken as the length of the weld times the effective throat.

The effective throat of a CJP groove weld shall be the thickness of the thinner part joined.

When filled flush to the surface, the effective weld throat for a PJP groove weld shall be as given in Table J2.1 and the effective weld throat for a flare groove weld shall be as given in Table J2.2. The effective throat of a PJP groove weld or flare groove weld filled less than flush shall be as shown in Table J2.1 or Table J2.2, less the greatest perpendicular dimension measured from a line flush to the base metal surface to the weld surface.

User Note: The effective throat of a PJP groove weld is dependent on the process used and the weld position. The design documents should either indicate the effective throat required or the weld strength required, and the fabricator should detail the joint based on the weld process and position to be used to weld the joint.

For PJP groove welds, effective throats larger than those for prequalified PJP groove welds in AWS D1.1/D1.1M, Figure 5.2, and flare groove welds in Table J2.2 are permitted for a given welding procedure specification (WPS), provided the fabricator establishes by testing the consistent production of such larger effective throats. Testing shall consist of sectioning the weld normal to its axis, at mid-length, and at terminal ends. Such sectioning shall be made on a number of combinations of material.

sizes representative of the range to be used in the fabrication. During production of welds with increased effective throats, single pass welds and the root pass of multipass welds shall be made using a mechanized, automatic, or robotic process, with no decrease in current or increase in travel speed from that used for testing.

### 1 b. Limitations

The minimum effective throat of a partial-joint-penetration groove weld shall not be less than the size required to transmit calculated forces nor the size shown in Table J2.3. Minimum weld size is determined by the thinner of the two parts joined.

### 2. Fillet Welds

### 2 a. Effective Area

The effective area of a fillet weld shall be the effective length multiplied by the effective throat. The effective throat of a fillet weld shall be the shortest distance from the root to the face of the diagrammatic weld. An increase in effective throat is permitted if consistent penetration beyond the root of the diagrammatic weld is demonstrated by tests using a given welding procedure specification (WPS), provided the fabricator establishes by testing the consistent production of such larger effective throat. Testing shall consist of sectioning the weld normal to its axis at mid-length.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_7/doc_14.md -->

and terminal ends. During production, single pass welds and the root pass of multipass welds shall be made using a mechanized, automatic, or robotic process with no decrease in current or increase in travel speed from that used for testing.

For fillet welds in holes and slots, the effective length shall be the length of the centerline of the weld along the center of the plane through the throat. In the case of overlapping fillets, the effective area shall not exceed the nominal cross-sectional area of the hole or slot in the plane of the faying surface.

### 2 b. Limitations

Fillet welds shall meet the following limitations:

(a) The minimum size of fillet welds shall be not less than the size required to transmit calculated forces nor the size as shown in Table J2.4. These limitations do not apply to fillet weld reinforcements of groove welds.

(b) The maximum specified size of fillet welds of connected parts shall be

(1) Along edges of material less than  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) thick; not greater than the thickness of the material.

(2) Along edges of material  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) or more in thickness; not greater than the thickness of the material minus  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm), unless the weld is especially designated on the design and fabrication documents to be built out to obtain full-throat thickness. In the as-welded condition, the distance between the edge of the base metal and the toe of the weld is permitted to be less than  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm), provided the weld size is clearly verifiable.

(c) The minimum length of fillet welds designed on the basis of strength shall be not less than four times the nominal weld size, or else the effective size of the weld shall not be taken to exceed one-quarter of its length.

(d) The effective length of end-loaded fillet welds shall be determined as follows:

(1) For fillet welds with a length up to 100 times the weld size, it is permitted to take the effective length equal to the actual length.

(2) When the length of the fillet weld exceeds 100 times the weld size, the effective length shall be determined by multiplying the actual length by the reduction factor,  $ \beta $ , determined as

 $$ \beta=1.2-0.002\big(l/w\big)\leq1.0 $$ 

where

l = actual length of end-loaded weld, in. (mm)

w = size of weld leg, in. (mm)

(3) When the length of the weld exceeds 300 times the leg size, w, the effective length shall be taken as 180w.

User Note: For the effect of longitudinal fillet weld length in end connections upon the effective area of the connected member, see Section D3.

(e) Intermittent fillet welds are permitted to be used to transfer calculated stress across a joint or faying surfaces and to join components of built-up members. The length of any segment of intermittent fillet welding shall be not less than four times the weld size, with a minimum of  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm).

(f) In lap joints, the minimum amount of lap shall be five times the thickness of the thinner part joined, but not less than 1 in. (25 mm). Lap joints joining plates or bars subjected to axial stress that utilize transverse fillet welds only shall be fillet welded along the end of both lapped parts, except where the deflection of the lapped parts is sufficiently restrained to prevent opening of the joint under maximum loading.

(g) Fillet weld terminations shall be detailed in a manner that does not result in a notch in the base metal subjected to applied tension loads. Components shall not be connected by welds where the weld would prevent the deformation required to provide assumed design conditions.

User Note: Fillet weld terminations should be detailed in a manner that does not result in a notch in the base metal transverse to applied tension loads that can occur as a result of normal fabrication. An accepted practice to avoid notches in base metal is to stop fillet welds short of the edge of the base metal by a length approximately equal to the size of the weld. In most welds, the effect of stopping short can be neglected in strength calculations.

There are two common details where welds are terminated short of the end of the joint to permit relative deformation between the connected parts:

• Welds on the outstanding legs of beam double-angle connections are returned on the top of the outstanding leg and stopped no more than 4 times the weld size and not greater than half the leg width from the outer toe of the angle.

- Fillet welds connecting transverse stiffeners to webs of girders that are  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm) thick or less are stopped 4 to 6 times the web thickness from the web toe of the flange-to web fillet weld, except where the end of the stiffener is welded to the flange.

Details of fillet weld terminations may be shown on shop standard details.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_7/doc_16.md -->

(h) Fillet welds in holes or slots are permitted to be used to transmit shear and resist loads perpendicular to the faying surface in lap joints or to prevent the buckling or separation of lapped parts and to join components of built-up members. Such fillet welds are permitted to overlap, subject to the provisions of Section J2. Fillet welds in holes or slots are not to be considered plug or slot welds.

(i) For fillet welds in slots, the ends of the slot shall be semicircular or shall have the corners rounded to a radius of not less than the thickness of the part containing it, except those ends that extend to the edge of the part.

### 3. Plug and Slot Welds

### 3 a. Effective Area

The effective shear area of plug and slot welds shall be taken as the nominal area of the hole or slot in the plane of the faying surface.

### 3 b. Limitations

Plug or slot welds are permitted to be used to transmit shear in lap joints or to prevent buckling or separation of lapped parts, and to join component parts of built-up members, subject to the following limitations:

(a) The diameter of the holes for a plug weld shall not be less than the thickness of the part containing it plus  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm), rounded to the next larger odd  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (even mm), nor greater than the minimum diameter plus  $ \frac{1}{8} $  in. (3 mm) or  $ 2\frac{1}{4} $  times the thickness of the weld.

(b) The minimum center-to-center spacing of plug welds shall be four times the diameter of the hole.

(c) The length of slot for a slot weld shall not exceed 10 times the thickness of the weld.

(d) The width of the slot shall be not less than the thickness of the part containing it plus  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) rounded to the next larger odd  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (even mm), nor shall it be larger than  $ 2\frac{1}{4} $  times the thickness of the weld.

(e) The ends of the slot shall be semicircular or shall have the corners rounded to a radius of not less than the thickness of the part containing it.

(f) The minimum spacing of lines of slot welds in a direction transverse to their length shall be four times the width of the slot.

(g) The minimum center-to-center spacing in a longitudinal direction on any line shall be two times the length of the slot.

(h) The thickness of plug or slot welds in material  $ \frac{1}{8} $  in. (16 mm) or less in thickness shall be equal to the thickness of the material. In material over  $ \frac{1}{8} $  in. (16 mm) thick, the thickness of the weld shall be at least one-half the thickness of the material, but not less than  $ \frac{1}{8} $  in. (16 mm).

### 4. Strength

(a) The design strength,  $ \phi R_{n} $ , and the allowable strength,  $ R_{n}/\Omega $ , of welded joints shall be the lower value of the base material strength determined according to the limit states of tensile rupture and shear rupture and the weld metal strength determined according to the limit state of rupture as follows.

For the base metal

 $$ R_{n}=F_{nBM}A_{BM} $$ 

For complete-joint-penetration and partial-joint-penetration groove welds, and plug and slot welds

 $$ R_{n}=F_{n w}A_{w e} $$ 

For fillet welds

 $$ R_{n}=F_{n w}A_{w e}k_{d s} $$ 

where

$A_{BM} = \text{area of the base metal, in.}^{2} (\text{mm}^{2})$

$A_{we} = \text{effective area of the weld, in.}^{2} (\text{mm}^{2})$

$F_{nBM} = \text{nominal stress of the base metal, ksi (MPa)}$

$F_{nw} = \text{nominal stress of the weld metal, ksi (MPa)}$

$k_{ds} = \text{directional strength increase factor}$

(1) For fillet welds where strain compatibility of the various weld elements is considered

 $$ k_{ds}=(1.0+0.50\mathrm{sin}^{1.5}\theta) $$ 

(2) For fillet welds to the ends of rectangular HSS loaded in tension

 $$ k_{ds}=1.0 $$ 

(3) For all other conditions

 $$ k_{ds}=1.0 $$ 

θ = angle between the line of action of the required force and the weld longitudinal axis, degrees

The values of  $ \phi $ ,  $ \Omega $ ,  $ F_{nBM} $ , and  $ F_{nw} $ , and limitations thereon, are given in Table J2.5.

User Note: The base metal check need not be performed for fillet welds as illustrated in the Commentary.

User Note: The instantaneous center method is a valid way to calculate the strength of weld groups consisting of weld elements in various directions that considers strain compatibility of the weld elements.

Strain compatibility is satisfied for a linear weld group with a uniform leg size connecting elements with uniform stiffness that are loaded through the center of gravity and, therefore, the directional strength increase may be used. A linear weld group is one in which all elements are in a line or are parallel.

### J3. BOLTS, THREADED PARTS, AND BOLTED CONNECTIONS

### 1. Common Bolts

ASTM A307 bolts are permitted except where pretensioning is specified.

### 2. High-Strength Bolts

Use of high-strength bolts and bolting components shall conform to the provisions of the RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts, hereafter referred to as the RCSC Specification, except where those provisions differ from this Specification. This Specification governs where provisions differ from the RCSC Specification.

User Note: Examples of provisions in the RCSC Specification that differ from this Specification’s provisions are shown in the Commentary.

High-strength bolts in this Specification are grouped according to material strength as follows:

Group 120 ASTM F3125/F3125M Grades A325, A325M, F1852, and ASTM A354 Grade BC

Group 144 ASTM F3148 Grade 144

Group 150 ASTM F3125/F3125M Grades A490, A490M, F2280, and ASTM A354 Grade BD

Group 200 ASTM F3043 and ASTM F3111

Use of Group 144 bolting assemblies shall conform to the provisions of ASTM F3148.

Use of Group 200 high-strength bolting assemblies shall conform to the applicable provisions of their ASTM standard. ASTM F3043 and ASTM F3111 Grade 1 assemblies may be installed only to the snug-tight condition. ASTM F3043 and ASTM F3111 Grade 2 assemblies may be used in snug-tight, pretensioned, and slip-critical connections, using procedures provided in the applicable ASTM standard.

User Note: The use of Group 200 bolting assemblies is limited to specific building locations and noncorrosive environmental conditions by the applicable ASTM standard.

When assembled, all joint surfaces, including those adjacent to the washers, shall be free of scale, except tight mill scale.

(a) Bolting assemblies are permitted to be installed to the snug-tight condition when used in

(1) Bearing-type connections, except as stipulated in Section E6

(2) Tension or combined shear and tension applications, for Group 120 bolts only, where loosening or fatigue due to vibration or load fluctuations are not design considerations

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_7/doc_22.md -->

(b) Bolts in the following connections shall be pretensioned:

(1) As required by the RCSC Specification

(2) Connections subjected to vibratory loads where bolt loosening is a consideration

(3) End connections of built-up members composed of two shapes either interconnected by bolts, or with at least one open side interconnected by perforated cover plates or lacing with tie plates, as required in Section E6.1

(c) The following connections shall be designed as slip-critical:

(1) As required by the RCSC Specification

(2) The extended portion of bolted, partial-length cover plates, as required in Section F13.3

The snug-tight condition is defined in the RCSC Specification. Bolts to be tightened to a condition other than snug tight shall be clearly identified on the design documents. (See Table J3.1 or J3.1M for minimum bolt pretension for connections designated as pretensioned or slip-critical.)

User Note: There are no specific minimum or maximum tension requirements for snug-tight bolts. Bolts that have been pretensioned are permitted in snug-tight connections unless specifically prohibited on design documents.

When bolt requirements cannot be provided within the RCSC Specification limitations because of requirements for lengths exceeding 12 diameters or diameters exceeding  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm), bolts or threaded rods conforming to Group 120 or Group 150 materials are permitted to be used in accordance with the provisions for threaded parts in Table J3.2.

When ASTM A354 Grade BC, ASTM A354 Grade BD, or ASTM A449 bolts and threaded rods are used in pretensioned connections, the bolt geometry, including the thread pitch, thread length, head, and nut(s), shall be equal to or (if larger in diameter) proportional to that required by the RCSC Specification. Installation shall comply with all applicable requirements of the RCSC Specification with modifications as required for the increased diameter and/or length to provide the design pretension.

### 3. Size and Use of Holes

The following requirements apply for bolted connections:

(a) The nominal dimensions of standard, oversized, short-slotted, and long-slotted holes for bolts are given in Table J3.3 or Table J3.3M.

User Note: Bolt holes with a smaller nominal diameter are permitted. See RCSC Specification Table 3.1 for bolt hole fabrication tolerances. See Section J9 for diameters of holes in base plates for anchor rods providing anchorage to concrete.

### 5. Minimum Edge Distance

The distance from the center of a standard hole to an edge of a connected part in any direction shall not be less than either the applicable value from Table J3.4 or Table J3.4M, or as required in Section J3.11.

[a]When the length of the slot is less than the maximum allowable (see Table J3.3M),  $ C_{2} $  is permitted to be reduced by one-half the difference between the maximum and actual slot lengths.

User Note: The edge distances in Tables J3.4 and J3.4M are minimum edge distances based on standard fabrication practices and workmanship tolerances. The appropriate provisions of Sections J3.11 and J4 must be satisfied.

### 6. Maximum Spacing and Edge Distance

The maximum distance from the center of any bolt hole to the nearest edge of elements in contact shall be 12 times the thickness of the connected element under consideration, but shall not exceed 6 in.

(a) For painted members or unpainted members not subject to atmospheric corrosion, the spacing shall not exceed 24 times the thickness of the thinner part or 12 in. (300 mm).

(b) For unpainted members of weathering steel subject to atmospheric corrosion, the spacing shall not exceed 14 times the thickness of the thinner part or 7 in. (180 mm).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_7/doc_28.md -->

User Note: The dimensions in (a) and (b) do not apply to elements consisting of two shapes in continuous contact.

### 7. Tensile and Shear Strength of Bolts and Threaded Parts

The design tensile or shear strength,  $ \phi R_{n} $ , and the allowable tensile or shear strength,  $ R_{n}/\Omega $ , of a snug-tightened or pretensioned high-strength bolt or threaded part shall be determined according to the limit states of tension rupture and shear rupture as

 $$ R_{n}=F_{n}A_{b} $$ 

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=2.00(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ A_{b}= $  nominal unthreaded body area of bolt or threaded part, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

Fn = nominal tensile stress, Fnt, or shear stress, Fnv, from Table J3.2, ksi (MPa)

The required tensile strength shall include any tension resulting from prying action produced by deformation of the connected parts.

User Note: The available strength of a bolt in shear depends on whether the bolt is sheared through its shank or through the threads or thread runout. Bolts that are relatively short may be produced as fully threaded, without a shank, and thus may not be able to be installed in the “threads excluded” condition.

User Note: The force that can be resisted by a snug-tightened or pretensioned high-strength bolt or threaded part may be limited by the bearing or tearout strength at the bolt hole per Section J3.11. The effective strength of an individual fastener may be taken as the lesser of the fastener shear strength per Section J3.7 or the bearing or tearout strength at the bolt hole per Section J3.11. The strength of the bolt group is taken as the sum of the effective strengths of the individual fasteners.

### 8. Combined Tension and Shear in Bearing-Type Connections

The available tensile strength of a bolt subjected to combined tension and shear shall be determined according to the limit states of tension and shear rupture as

 $$ R_{n}=F_{n t}^{\prime}A_{b} $$ 

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=2.00(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ F_{nt}^{\prime} $  = nominal tensile stress modified to include the effects of shear stress, ksi (MPa)

 $$ =1.3F_{nt}-\frac{F_{nt}}{\phi F_{nv}}f_{rv}\leq F_{nt}(LRFD) $$ 

 $$ =1.3F_{nt}-\frac{\Omega F_{nt}}{F_{nv}}f_{rv}\leq F_{nt}(ASD) $$ 

 $ F_{nt} $  = nominal tensile stress from Table J3.2, ksi (MPa)

 $ F_{nv} $  = nominal shear stress from Table J3.2, ksi (MPa)



frv = required shear stress using LRFD or ASD load combinations, ksi (MPa)

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_7/doc_29.md -->

The available shear stress of the fastener shall equal or exceed the required shear stress, $ f_{rv} $ .

User Note: Note that when the required stress, f, in either shear or tension, is less than or equal to 30% of the corresponding available stress, the effects of combined stress need not be investigated. Also note that Equations J3-3a and J3-3b can be rewritten so as to find a nominal shear stress,  $ F_{nv}' $ , as a function of the required tensile stress,  $ f_{t} $ .

### 9. High-Strength Bolts in Slip-Critical Connections

Slip-critical connections shall be designed to prevent slip and for the limit states of bearing-type connections. When slip-critical bolts pass through fillers, all surfaces subject to slip shall be prepared to achieve design slip resistance.

 $$ \phi=1.00(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=1.50(ASD) $$ 

(b) For oversized and short-slotted holes parallel to the direction of the load

 $$ \phi=0.85(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=1.76(ASD) $$ 

(c) For long-slotted holes

 $$ \phi=0.70(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=2.14(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ D_{u}=1.13 $ , a multiplier that reflects the ratio of the mean installed bolt pretension to the specified minimum bolt pretension. The use of other values are permitted if approved by the engineer of record.

 $ T_{b} $  = minimum fastener pretension given in Table J3.1 or Table J3.1M, kips (kN)

 $ h_{f} $  = factor for fillers, determined as follows:

(1) For one filler between connected parts

 $$ h_{f}=1.0 $$ 

(2) For two or more fillers between connected parts

 $$ h_{f}=0.85 $$ 

 $ n_{s} $  = number of slip planes required to permit the connection to slip

 $ \mu $  = mean slip coefficient for Class A or B surfaces, as applicable, and determined as follows, or as established by tests:

(1) For Class A surfaces (unpainted clean mill scale steel surfaces or surfaces with Class A coatings on blast-cleaned steel or hot-dipped galvanized steel whether as-galvanized or hand roughened)

 $$ \mu=0.30 $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_8/doc_0.md -->

(2) For Class B surfaces (unpainted blast-cleaned steel surfaces or surfaces with Class B coatings on blast-cleaned steel)

### 10. Combined Tension and Shear in Slip-Critical Connections

When a slip-critical connection is subjected to an applied tension that reduces the net clamping force, the available slip resistance per bolt from Section J3.9 shall be multiplied by the factor,  $ k_{sc} $ , determined as follows:

 $ n_{b} $  = number of bolts carrying the applied tension

 $$ R_{n}=\frac{1.2\Big(F_{y}-90\Big)l_{b}d}{20} $$ 

(2) When d > 25 in. (630 mm)

 $$ R_{n}=\frac{6.0\Big(F_{y}-13\Big)l_{b}\sqrt{d}}{20} $$

 $ l_{b}= $  length of bearing, in. (mm)

### J8. COLUMN BASES AND BEARING ON CONCRETE

Provisions shall be made to transfer the column loads and moments to the footings and foundations.

In the absence of code regulations, the design bearing strength,  $ \phi_{c}P_{p} $ , and the allowable bearing strength,  $ P_{p}/\Omega_{c} $ , for the limit state of concrete crushing are permitted to be taken as follows:

 $$ \phi_{c}=0.65(LRFD)\qquad\Omega_{c}=2.31(ASD) $$

Anchor rods shall be designed to provide the required resistance to loads on the completed structure at the base of columns including the net tensile components of any bending moment resulting from load combinations stipulated in Section B2. The anchor rods shall be designed in accordance with the requirements for threaded parts in Table J3.2.

Design of anchor rods for the transfer of forces to the concrete foundation shall satisfy the requirements of ACI 318 (ACI 318M) or ACI 349 (ACI 349M).

User Note: Column bases should be designed considering bearing against concrete elements, including when columns are required to resist a horizontal force at the base plate. See AISC Design Guide 1, Base Plate and Anchor Rod Design, Second Edition, for column base design information.

When anchor rods are used to resist horizontal forces, hole size, anchor rod setting tolerance, and the horizontal movement of the column shall be considered in the design.

Holes and slots larger than oversized holes and slots in Table J3.3 or Table J3.3M are permitted in base plates when adequate bearing is provided for the nut by using ASTM F844 washers or plate washers to bridge the hole.

User Note: The recommended hole sizes and corresponding washer dimensions and nuts are given in the AISC Steel Construction Manual and ASTM F1554. ASTM F1554 anchor rods may be furnished in accordance with product specifications with a body diameter less than the nominal diameter. Load effects such as bending and elongation should be calculated based on minimum diameters permitted by the product specification. See ASTM F1554 and the table, "Applicable ASTM Specifications for Various Types of Structural Fasteners," in the AISC Steel Construction Manual Part 2.

### J10. FLANGES AND WEBS WITH CONCENTRATED FORCES

This section applies to single- and double-concentrated forces applied normal to the flange(s) of wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes. A single-concentrated force is either tensile or compressive. Double-concentrated forces are one tensile and one compressive and form a couple on the same side of the loaded member.

When the required strength exceeds the available strength as determined for the limit states listed in this section, stiffeners and/or doublers shall be provided and shall be sized for the difference between the required strength and the available strength for the applicable limit state. Stiffeners shall also meet the design requirements in Section J10.8. Doublers shall also meet the design requirements in Section J10.9.

### 1. Flange Local Bending

This section applies to tensile single-concentrated forces and the tensile component of double-concentrated forces.

The design strength,  $ \phi R_{n} $ , and the allowable strength,  $ R_{n}/\Omega $ , for the limit state of flange local bending shall be determined as

# CHAPTER K ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HSS AND BOX-SECTION CONNECTIONS

This chapter addresses additional requirements for connections to HSS members and box sections of uniform wall thickness, where seam welds between box-section elements are complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove welds in the connection region. The requirements of Chapter J also apply.

The chapter is organized as follows:

K1. General Provisions and Parameters for HSS Connections

K2. Concentrated Forces on HSS

K3. HSS-to-HSS Truss Connections

K4. HSS-to-HSS Moment Connections

K5. Welds of Plates and Branches to HSS

### K1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND PARAMETERS FOR HSS CONNECTIONS

For the purposes of this chapter, the centerlines of branch members and chord members shall lie in a common plane. Rectangular HSS connections are further limited to having all members oriented with walls parallel to the plane.

The tables in this chapter are often accompanied by limits of applicability. Connections complying with the limits of applicability listed can be designed considering the limit states provided for each joint configuration. Connections not complying with the limits of applicability listed are not prohibited and must be designed by rational analysis.

User Note: The connection strengths calculated in Chapter K, including the applicable sections of Chapter J, are based on strength limit states only. See the Commentary if excessive connection deformations may cause serviceability or stability concerns.

User Note: Connection strength is often governed by the size of HSS members, especially the wall thickness of truss chords, and this must be considered in the initial design. To ensure economical and dependable connections can be designed, the connections should be considered in the design of the members. Angles between the chord and the branch(es) of less than  $ 30^{\circ} $  can make welding and inspection difficult and should be avoided. The limits of applicability provided reflect limitations on tests conducted to date, measures to eliminate undesirable limit states, and other considerations discussed in the Commentary. See Section J3.11b for through-bolt provisions.

A connection shall be classified as

(a) A T-connection when there is one branch and it is perpendicular to the chord and as a Y-connection when there is one branch, but not perpendicular to the chord

(b) A cross-connection when there is a branch on each (opposite) side of the chord

### 1. Definitions of Parameters

 $ Z_{b}= $  plastic section modulus of branch about the axis of bending, in. $ ^{3} $  (mm $ ^{3} $ )

### 2. Round HSS

The available strength of round HSS-to-HSS moment connections within the limits of Table K4.1A shall be taken as the lowest value of the applicable limit states shown in Table K4.1.

### 3. Rectangular HSS

The available strength,  $ \phi P_{n} $  and  $ P_{n}/\Omega $ , of rectangular HSS-to-HSS moment connections within the limits in Table K4.2A shall be taken as the lowest value obtained according to limit states shown in Table K4.2 and Chapter J.

User Note: Outside the limits in Table K4.2A, the limit states of Chapter J are still applicable and the applicable limit states of Chapter K are not defined.

### K5. WELDS OF PLATES AND BRANCHES TO HSS

The available strength of branch connections shall be determined considering the nonuniformity of load transfer along the line of weld, due to differences in relative stiffness of HSS walls in HSS-to-HSS connections and between elements in transverse plate-to-HSS connections, as follows:

 $$ R_{n}\mathrm{o r}P_{n}=F_{n w}t_{w}l_{e} $$ 

 $$ M_{n-i p}=F_{n w}S_{i p} $$ 

 $$ M_{n-o p}=F_{n w}S_{o p} $$ 

Interaction shall be considered.

(a) For fillet welds

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD)\quad\Omega=2.00(ASD) $$ 

(b) For partial-joint-penetration groove welds

 $$ \phi=0.80(LRFD)\quad\Omega=1.88(ASD) $$

$S_{ip} = \text{effective elastic section modulus of welds for in-plane bending (Table K5.1), in.}^{3} (\text{mm}^{3})$

$S_{op} = \text{effective elastic section modulus of welds for out-of-plane bending (Table K5.1), in.}^{3} (\text{mm}^{3})$

$l_{e}$ = total effective weld length of groove and fillet welds to HSS for weld strength calculations, in. (mm)

 $ t_{w} $  = smallest effective weld throat thickness around the perimeter of branch or plate, in. (mm)

User Note: Where flexure results in tension in any load case in the weld the directional strength increase factor cannot exceed 1.0 in fillet welds to the end of rectangular HSS.

When a rectangular overlapped K-connection has been designed in accordance with Table K3.2, and the branch member component forces normal to the chord are 80% balanced (in other words, the branch member forces normal to the chord face differ by no more than 20%), the hidden weld under an overlapping branch may be omitted if the remaining welds to the overlapped branch everywhere develop the full capacity of the overlapped branch member walls.

The weld checks in Tables K5.1 and K5.2 are not required if the welds are capable of developing the full strength of the branch member wall along its entire perimeter (or a plate along its entire length).

User Note: The approach used here to allow downsizing of welds assumes a constant weld size around the full perimeter of the HSS branch. Special attention is required for equal width (or near-equal width) connections to rectangular HSS, which combine partial-joint-penetration groove welds along the matched edges of the connection, with fillet welds generally across the chord member face.

# CHAPTER L DESIGN FOR SERVICEABILITY

This chapter addresses the evaluation of the structure and its components for the serviceability limit states of deflections, drift, vibration, wind-induced motion, thermal distortion, and connection slip.

The chapter is organized as follows:

L1. General Provisions

L2. Deflections

L3. Drift

L4. Vibration

L5. Wind-Induced Motion

L6. Thermal Expansion and Contraction

L7. Connection Slip

### L1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Serviceability is a state in which the function of a building, its appearance, maintainability, durability, and the comfort of its occupants are preserved under typical usage. Limiting values of structural behavior for serviceability (such as maximum deflections and accelerations) shall be chosen with due regard to the intended function of the structure. Serviceability shall be evaluated using applicable load combinations.

User Note: Serviceability limit states, service loads, and appropriate load combinations for serviceability considerations can be found in ASCE Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE/SEI 7) Appendix C and its Commentary. The performance requirements for serviceability in this chapter are consistent with ASCE/SEI 7, Appendix C. Service loads are those that act on the structure at an arbitrary point in time and are not usually taken as the nominal loads.

Reduced stiffness values used in the direct analysis method, described in Chapter C, are not intended for use with the provisions of this chapter.

### L2. DEFLECTIONS

Deflections in structural members and structural systems shall be limited so as not to impair the serviceability of the structure.

### L3. DRIFT

Drift shall be limited so as not to impair the serviceability of the structure.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_2.md -->

### L4. VIBRATION

The effect of vibration on the comfort of the occupants and the function of the structure shall be considered. The sources of vibration to be considered include occupant loading, vibrating machinery, and others identified for the structure.

### L5. WIND-INDUCED MOTION

The effect of wind-induced motion of buildings on the comfort of occupants shall be considered.

### L6. THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION

The effects of thermal expansion and contraction of a building shall be considered.

### L7. CONNECTION SLIP

The effects of connection slip shall be included in the design where slip at bolted connections may cause deformations that impair the serviceability of the structure. Where appropriate, the connection shall be designed to preclude slip.

User Note: For the design of slip-critical connections, see Sections J3.9 and J3.10. For more information on connection slip, refer to the RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts.

(5 mm) deep and sharp V-shaped notches. Gouges deeper than  $ \frac{3}{16} $  in. (5 mm) and notches shall be removed by grinding or repaired by welding.

Reentrant corners shall be formed with a curved transition. The radius need not exceed that required to fit the connection. Discontinuous corners are permitted where the material on both sides of the discontinuous reentrant corner is connected to a mating piece to prevent deformation and associated stress concentration at the corner.

User Note: Reentrant corners with a radius of  $ \frac{1}{2} $  to  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (13 to 10 mm) are generally acceptable for statically loaded work. Where pieces need to fit tightly together, a discontinuous reentrant corner is acceptable if the pieces are connected close to the corner on both sides of the discontinuous corner. Slots in HSS for gussets may be made with semicircular ends or with curved corners. Square ends are acceptable provided the edge of the gusset is welded to the HSS.

Weld access holes shall meet the geometrical requirements of Section J1.6. Beam copes and weld access holes in shapes that are to be galvanized shall be ground to bright metal. For shapes with a flange thickness not exceeding 2 in. (50 mm), the roughness of thermally cut surfaces of copes shall be no greater than a surface roughness value of 2,000  $ \mu $ m. (50  $ \mu $ m) as defined in Surface Texture, Surface Roughness, Waviness, and Lay (ASME B46.1), hereafter referred to as ASME B46.1. For beam copes and weld access holes in which the curved part of the access hole is thermally cut in ASTM A6/A6M hot-rolled shapes with a flange thickness exceeding 2 in. (50 mm) and welded built-up shapes with material thickness greater than 2 in. (50 mm), a preheat temperature of not less than 150°F (66°C) shall be applied prior to thermal cutting.

### 5 b. CJP Groove Weld NDT

For structures in risk category III or IV, as defined in ASCE/SEI 7, UT shall be performed by QA on all complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove welds subjected to transversely applied tension loading in butt, T-, and corner joints, in material  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) thick or greater. For structures in risk category II, UT shall be performed by QA on 10% of CJP groove welds in butt, T-, and corner joints subjected to transversely applied tension loading, in materials  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) thick or greater.

User Note: For structures in risk category I, NDT of CJP groove welds is not required. For all structures in all risk categories, NDT of CJP groove welds in materials less than  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) thick is not required.

### 5 c. Welded Joints Subjected to Fatigue

When required by Appendix 3, Table A-3.1, welded joints requiring weld soundness to be established by radiographic or ultrasonic inspection shall be tested by QA as prescribed. Reduction in the rate of UT is prohibited.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_17.md -->

### 5 d. Ultrasonic Testing Rejection Rate

The ultrasonic testing rejection rate shall be determined as the number of welds containing defects divided by the number of welds completed. Welds that contain acceptable discontinuities shall not be considered as having defects when the rejection rate is determined. For evaluating the rejection rate of continuous welds over 3 ft (1 m) in length where the effective throat is 1 in. (25 mm) or less, each 12 in. (300 mm) increment or fraction thereof shall be considered as one weld. For evaluating the rejection rate on continuous welds over 3 ft (1 m) in length where the effective throat is greater than 1 in. (25 mm), each 6 in. (150 mm) of length, or fraction thereof, shall be considered one weld.

### 5 e. Reduction of Ultrasonic Testing Rate

For projects that contain 40 or fewer welds, there shall be no reduction in the ultrasonic testing rate. The rate of UT is permitted to be reduced if approved by the EOR and the AHJ. Where the initial rate of UT is 100%, the NDT rate for an individual welder or welding operator is permitted to be reduced to 25%, provided the rejection rate, the number of welds containing unacceptable defects divided by the number of welds completed, is demonstrated to be 5% or less of the welds tested for the welder or welding operator. A sampling of at least 40 completed welds shall be made for such reduced evaluation on each project.

### 5 f. Increase in Ultrasonic Testing Rate

For structures in risk category II and higher (where the initial rate for UT is 10%) the NDT rate for an individual welder or welding operator shall be increased to 100% should the rejection rate (the number of welds containing unacceptable defects divided by the number of welds completed) exceed 5% of the welds tested for the welder or welding operator. A sampling of at least 20 completed welds on each project shall be made prior to implementing such an increase. If the rejection rate for the welder or welding operator falls to 5% or less on the basis of at least 40 completed welds, the rate of UT may be decreased to 10%.

### 5 g. Documentation

All NDT performed shall be documented. For shop fabrication, the NDT report shall identify the tested weld by piece mark and location in the piece. For field work, the NDT report shall identify the tested weld by location in the structure, piece mark, and location in the piece.

When a weld is rejected on the basis of NDT, the NDT record shall indicate the location of the defect and the basis of rejection.

### 6. Inspection of High-Strength Bolting

Observation of bolting operations shall be the primary method used to confirm that the materials, procedures, and workmanship incorporated in construction are in conformance with the construction documents and the provisions of the RCSC Specification.

# APPENDIX 1 DESIGN BY ADVANCED ANALYSIS

This appendix permits the use of advanced methods of structural analysis to directly model system and member imperfections, and/or allow for the redistribution of member and connection forces and moments as a result of localized yielding.

The appendix is organized as follows:

1.1 General Requirements

1.2 Design by Elastic Analysis

1.3 Design by Inelastic Analysis

#### 1.1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The analysis methods permitted in this appendix shall ensure that equilibrium and compatibility are satisfied for the structure in its deformed shape, including all flexural, shear, axial, and torsional deformations, and all other component and connection deformations that contribute to the displacements of the structure.

Design by the methods of this appendix shall be conducted in accordance with Section B3.1, using load and resistance factor design (LRFD).

#### 1.2. DESIGN BY ELASTIC ANALYSIS

### 1. General Stability Requirements

Design by a second-order elastic analysis that includes the direct modeling of system and member imperfections is permitted for all structures subject to the limitations defined in this section. All requirements of Section C1 apply, along with the following additional requirements and exceptions. All load-dependent effects shall be calculated at a level of loading corresponding to LRFD load combinations.

The influence of torsion shall be considered, including its impact on member deformations and second-order effects.

The provisions of this method apply only to doubly symmetric members, including I-shapes, HSS, and box sections, unless evidence is provided that the method is applicable to other member types.

### 2. Calculation of Required Strengths

For design using a second-order elastic analysis that includes the direct modeling of system and member imperfections, the required strengths of components of the structure shall be determined from an analysis conforming to Section C2, with additional requirements and exceptions as noted in the following.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_23.md -->

### 2 a. General Analysis Requirements

The analysis of the structure shall also conform to the following requirements:

(a) Torsional member deformations shall be considered in the analysis.

(b) The analysis shall consider geometric nonlinearities, including  $ P-\Delta $ ,  $ P-\delta $ , and twisting effects as applicable to the structure. The use of the approximate procedures appearing in Appendix 8 is not permitted.

User Note: A rigorous second-order analysis of the structure is an important requirement for this method of design. Many analysis routines common in design offices are based on a more traditional second-order analysis approach that includes only  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects without consideration of additional second-order effects related to member twist, which can be significant for some members with unbraced lengths near or exceeding  $ L_{r} $ . The type of second-order analysis defined herein also includes the beneficial effects of additional member torsional strength and stiffness due to warping restraint, which can be conservatively neglected. Refer to the Commentary for additional information and guidance.

(c) In all cases, the analysis shall directly model the effects of initial imperfections due to both points of intersection of members displaced from their nominal locations (system imperfections), and initial out-of-straightness or offsets of members along their length (member imperfections). The magnitude of the initial displacements shall be the maximum amount considered in the design; the pattern of initial displacements shall be such that it provides the greatest destabilizing effect for the load combination being considered. The use of notional loads to represent either type of imperfection is not permitted.

User Note: Initial displacements similar in configuration to both displacements due to loading and anticipated buckling modes should be considered in the modeling of imperfections. The magnitude of the initial points of intersection of members displaced from their nominal locations (system imperfections) should be based on permissible construction tolerances, as specified in the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges or other governing requirements, or on actual imperfections, if known. When these displacements are due to erection tolerances, 1/500 is often considered based on the tolerance of the out-of-plumbness ratio specified in the Code of Standard Practice. For out-of-straightness of members (member imperfections), a 1/1,000 out-of-straightness ratio is often considered. Refer to the Commentary for additional guidance.

### 2 b. Adjustments to Stiffness

The analysis of the structure to determine the required strengths of components shall use reduced stiffnesses as defined in Section C2.3. Such stiffness reduction, including factors of 0.8 and  $ \tau_{b} $ , shall be applied to all stiffnesses that are considered to contribute to the stability of the structure. The use of notional loads to represent  $ \tau_{b} $  is not permitted.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_24.md -->

User Note: Stiffness reduction should be applied to all member properties including torsional properties (GJ and  $ EC_{w} $ ) affecting twist of the member cross section. One practical method of including stiffness reduction is to reduce E and G by  $ 0.8\tau_{b} $ , thereby leaving all cross-section geometric properties at their nominal value.

Applying this stiffness reduction to some members and not others can, in some cases, result in artificial distortion of the structure under load and thereby lead to an unintended redistribution of forces. This can be avoided by applying the reduction to all members, including those that do not contribute to the stability of the structure.

### 3. Calculation of Available Strengths

For design using a second-order elastic analysis that includes the direct modeling of system and member imperfections, the available strengths of members and connections shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapters D through K, as applicable, except as defined below, with no further consideration of overall structure stability.

The nominal compressive strength of members,  $ P_{n} $ , may be taken as the cross-section compressive strength,  $ F_{y}A_{g} $ , or as  $ F_{y}A_{e} $  for members with slender elements, where  $ A_{e} $  is as defined in Section E7.

#### 1.3. DESIGN BY INELASTIC ANALYSIS

User Note: Design by the provisions of this section is independent of the requirements of Section 1.2.

### 1. General Requirements

The design strength of the structural system and its members and connections shall equal or exceed the required strength as determined by the inelastic analysis. The provisions of Section 1.3 do not apply to seismic design.

The inelastic analysis shall take into account (a) flexural, shear, axial, and torsional member deformations, and all other component and connection deformations that contribute to the displacements of the structure; (b) second-order effects (including  $ P-\Delta $ ,  $ P-\delta $ , and twisting effects); (c) geometric imperfections; (d) stiffness reductions due to inelasticity, including partial yielding of the cross section that may be accentuated by the presence of residual stresses; and (e) uncertainty in system, member, and connection strength and stiffness.

Strength limit states detected by an inelastic analysis that incorporates all of the preceding requirements in this section are not subject to the corresponding provisions of this Specification when a comparable or higher level of reliability is provided by the analysis. Strength limit states not detected by the inelastic analysis shall be evaluated using the corresponding provisions of Chapters D through K.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_25.md -->

Connections shall meet the requirements of Section B3.4.

Members and connections subject to inelastic deformations shall be shown to have ductility consistent with the intended behavior of the structural system. Force redistribution due to rupture of a member or connection is not permitted.

Any method that uses inelastic analysis to proportion members and connections to satisfy these general requirements is permitted. A design method based on inelastic analysis that meets the preceding strength requirements, the ductility requirements of Section 1.3.2, and the analysis requirements of Section 1.3.3 satisfies these general requirements.

### 2. Ductility Requirements

Members and connections with elements subject to yielding shall be proportioned such that all inelastic deformation demands are less than or equal to their inelastic deformation capacities. In lieu of explicitly ensuring that the inelastic deformation demands are less than or equal to their inelastic deformation capacities, the following requirements shall be satisfied for steel members subject to plastic hinging.

### 2 a. Material

The specified minimum yield stress,  $ F_{y} $ , of members subject to plastic hinging shall not exceed 65 ksi (450 MPa).

### 2 b. Cross Section

The cross section of members at plastic hinge locations shall be doubly symmetric with width-to-thickness ratios of their compression elements not exceeding  $ \lambda_{pd} $ , where  $ \lambda_{pd} $  is equal to  $ \lambda_{p} $  from Table B4.1b, except as modified in the following:

(a) For the width-to-thickness ratio,  $ h/t_{w} $ , of webs of I-shaped members, rectangular HSS, and box sections subjected to combined flexure and compression

(1) When  $ P_{u}/\phi_{c}P_{y}\leq0.125 $ 

 $$ \lambda_{pd}=3.76\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}}\left(1-\frac{2.75P_{u}}{\phi_{c}P_{y}}\right) $$ 

(2) When  $ P_{u}/\phi_{c}P_{y}>0.125 $ 

 $$ \lambda_{pd}=1.12\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}}\left(2.33-\frac{P_{u}}{\phi_{c}P_{y}}\right)\geq1.49\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}} $$ 

where

 $ P_{u}= $  required axial strength in compression, using LRFD load combinations, kips (N)

 $$ P_{y}=\mathrm{axial~yield~strength,~kips~(N)} $$ 

 $$ =F_{y}A_{g} $$ 

h = as defined in Section B4.1, in. (mm)

 $ t_{w} $  = thickness of web, in. (mm)

 $ \phi_{c} $  = resistance factor for compression

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_26.md -->

(b) For the width-to-thickness ratio, b/t, of flanges of rectangular HSS and box sections, and for flange cover plates between lines of fasteners or welds

 $$ \lambda_{pd}=0.94\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $$ 

where

b = as defined in Section B4.1, in. (mm)

t = as defined in Section B4.1, in. (mm)

(c) For the diameter-to-thickness ratio, D/t, of round HSS in flexure

 $$ \lambda_{pd}=0.045E/F_{y} $$ 

where

D = outside diameter of round HSS, in. (mm)

### 2 c. Unbraced Length

In prismatic member segments that contain plastic hinges, the laterally unbraced length,  $ L_{b} $ , shall not exceed  $ L_{pd} $ , determined as follows. For members subjected to flexure only, or to flexure and axial tension,  $ L_{b} $  shall be taken as the length between points braced against lateral displacement of the compression flange, or between points braced to prevent twist of the cross section. For members subjected to flexure and axial compression,  $ L_{b} $  shall be taken as the length between points braced against both lateral displacement in the minor-axis direction and twist of the cross section.

(a) For I-shaped members bent about their major axis

 $$ L_{pd}=\left(0.12-0.076\frac{M_{1}^{\prime}}{M_{2}}\right)\frac{E}{F_{y}}r_{y} $$ 

where

 $ r_{y} $  = radius of gyration about minor axis, in. (mm)

(1) When the magnitude of the bending moment at any location within the unbraced length exceeds  $ M_{2} $ 

 $$ M_{1}^{^{\prime}}/M_{2}=+1 $$ 

Otherwise.

(2) When  $ M_{mid} \leq (M_{1} + M_{2})/2 $ 

 $$ M_{1}^{^{\prime}}=M_{1} $$ 

(3) When  $ M_{mid} > \left(M_{1} + M_{2}\right)/2 $ 

 $$ M_{1}^{^{\prime}}=\left(2M_{mid}-M_{2}\right)<M_{2} $$ 

where

 $$ M_{mid}=moment at middle of unbraced length,kip-in.(N-mm) $$ 

 $$ M_{1}=\text{smaller moment at end of unbraced length, kip-in. (N-mm)} $$ 

 $ M_{2} $  = larger moment at end of unbraced length, kip-in. (N-mm) (shall be taken as positive in all cases)

 $ M_{1}^{\prime} $  = effective moment at end of unbraced length opposite from  $ M_{2} $ ,

kip-in. (N-mm)

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_27.md -->

The moments  $ M_{1} $  and  $ M_{mid} $  are individually taken as positive when they cause compression in the same flange as the moment  $ M_{2} $ , and taken as negative otherwise.

(b) For solid rectangular bars and for rectangular HSS and box sections bent about their major axis

 $$ L_{pd}=\left(0.17-0.10\frac{M_{1}^{\prime}}{M_{2}}\right)\frac{E}{F_{y}}r_{y}\geq0.10\frac{E}{F_{y}}r_{y} $$ 

For all types of members subjected to axial compression and containing plastic hinges, the laterally unbraced lengths about the cross-section major and minor axes shall not exceed  $ 4.71r_{x}\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  and  $ 4.71r_{y}\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , respectively.

There is no  $ L_{pd} $  limit for member segments containing plastic hinges in the following cases:

(a) Members with round or square cross sections subjected only to flexure or to combined flexure and tension

(b) Members subjected only to flexure about their minor axis or combined tension and flexure about their minor axis

(c) Members subjected only to tension

### 2 d. Axial Force

To ensure ductility in compression members with plastic hinges, the design strength in compression shall not exceed  $ 0.75F_{y}A_{g} $ .

### 3. Analysis Requirements

The structural analysis shall satisfy the general requirements of Section 1.3.1. These requirements are permitted to be satisfied by a second-order inelastic analysis meeting the requirements of this section.

Exception: For continuous beams not subjected to axial compression, a first-order inelastic or plastic analysis is permitted and the requirements of Sections 1.3.3b and 1.3.3c are waived.

User Note: Refer to the Commentary for guidance in conducting a traditional plastic analysis and design in conformance with these provisions.

### 3 a. Material Properties and Yield Criteria

The specified minimum yield stress,  $ F_{y} $ , and the stiffness of all steel members and connections shall be reduced by a factor of 0.9 for the analysis, except as stipulated in Section 1.3.3c.

The influence of axial force, major-axis bending moment, and minor-axis bending moment shall be included in the calculation of the inelastic response.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_9/doc_28.md -->

The plastic strength of the member cross section shall be represented in the analysis either by an elastic-perfectly-plastic yield criterion expressed in terms of the axial force, major-axis bending moment, and minor-axis bending moment, or by explicit modeling of the material stress-strain response as elastic-perfectly-plastic.

### 3 b. Geometric Imperfections

In all cases, the analysis shall directly model the effects of initial imperfections due to both points of intersection of members displaced from their nominal locations (system imperfections) and initial out-of-straightness or offsets of members along their length (member imperfections). The magnitude of the initial displacements shall be the maximum amount considered in the design; the pattern of initial displacements shall be such that it provides the greatest destabilizing effect.

### 3 c. Residual Stress and Partial Yielding Effects

The analysis shall include the influence of residual stresses and partial yielding. This shall be done by explicitly modeling these effects in the analysis or by reducing the stiffness of all structural components as specified in Section C2.3.

### I f the provisions of Section C2.3 are used, then

(a) The 0.9 stiffness reduction factor specified in Section 1.3.3a shall be replaced by the reduction of the modulus of elasticity, E, by 0.80 as specified in Section C2.3, and

(b) The elastic-perfectly-plastic yield criterion, expressed in terms of the axial force, major-axis bending moment, and minor-axis bending moment, shall satisfy the cross-section strength limit defined by Equations H1-1a and H1-1b using  $ P_{c}=0.9P_{y} $ ,  $ M_{cx}=0.9M_{px} $ , and  $ M_{cy}=0.9M_{py} $ .

# APPENDIX 2 DESIGN OF FILLED COMPOSITE MEMBERS (HIGH STRENGTH)

This appendix provides methods for calculating the design strength of filled composite members constructed from either one or both materials (steel or concrete) with strengths above the limits noted in Section I1.3. All other provisions of Chapter I shall apply.

#### 2.1. RECTANGULAR FILLED COMPOSITE MEMBERS

### 1. Limitations

For rectangular filled composite members, the following limitations shall be met:

(e) Longitudinal reinforcement is not required. If longitudinal reinforcement is provided, it shall not be considered in the calculation of available strength, and the minimum reinforcement requirements of Sections I2.2a and I3.4a shall apply.

### 2. Compressive Strength

The available compressive strength shall be determined in accordance with Section I2.2b with the following modifications:

 $$ P_{no}=F_{n}A_{s}+0.85f_{c}^{\prime}A_{c} $$ 

 $$ F_{n}=(1.0-0.075\lambda)F_{y} $$

### 4. Combined Flexure and Axial Force

The interaction of flexure and compression shall be limited by Equations I5-1a and I5-1b, where the term  $ c_{p} $  is determined using Equation A-2-3 and  $ c_{m} $  is determined using Equation A-2-4:

 $$ c_{p}=0.175-\frac{0.075}{B/H}+\lambda\Bigg(\frac{0.3}{P_{n}/P_{no}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{f_{c}^{\prime}}{F_{y}}\Bigg) $$ 

 $$ c_{m}=0.6+0.3\Bigg(\frac{P_{n}}{P_{no}}\Bigg)^{2}+0.6\lambda\Bigg(\frac{B}{H}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{F_{y,max}}{F_{y}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{f_{c}^{\prime}}{F_{y}}\Bigg) $$ 

where

# APPENDIX 3

# FATIGUE

This appendix applies to members and connections subjected to high-cycle loading within the elastic range of stresses of frequency and magnitude sufficient to initiate cracking and progressive failure.

User Note: See AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings for structures subjected to seismic loads.

The appendix is organized as follows:

3.1. General Provisions

3.2. Calculation of Maximum Stresses and Stress Ranges

3.3. Plain Material and Welded Joints

3.4. Bolts and Threaded Parts

3.5. Fabrication and Erection Requirements for Fatigue

3.6. Nondestructive Examination Requirements for Fatigue

#### 3.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

The fatigue resistance of members consisting of shapes or plate shall be determined when the number of cycles of application of live load exceeds 20,000. No evaluation of fatigue resistance of members consisting of HSS in building-type structures subject to code mandated wind loads is required. When the applied cyclic stress range is less than the threshold allowable stress range,  $ F_{TH} $ , no further evaluation of fatigue resistance is required. See Table A-3.1.

The engineer of record shall provide either complete details including weld sizes or shall specify the planned cycle life and the maximum range of moments, shears, and reactions for the connections.

The provisions of this appendix shall apply to stresses calculated on the basis of the applied cyclic load spectrum. The maximum permitted stress due to peak cyclic loads shall be  $ 0.66F_{y} $ . In the case of a stress reversal, the stress range shall be computed as the numerical sum of maximum repeated tensile and compressive stresses or the numerical sum of maximum shearing stresses of opposite direction at the point of probable crack initiation.

The cyclic load resistance determined by the provisions of this appendix is applicable to structures with suitable corrosion protection or subjected only to mildly corrosive atmospheres, such as normal atmospheric conditions.

The cyclic load resistance determined by the provisions of this appendix is applicable only to structures subjected to temperatures not exceeding  $ 300^{\circ} $ F ( $ 150^{\circ} $ C).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_10/doc_2.md -->

#### 3.2. CALCULATION OF MAXIMUM STRESSES AND STRESS RANGES

Calculated stresses shall be based upon elastic analysis. Stresses shall not be amplified by stress concentration factors for geometrical discontinuities.

For bolts and threaded rods subjected to axial tension, the calculated stresses shall include the effects of prying action, if any. In the case of axial stress combined with bending, the maximum stresses of each kind shall be those determined for concurrent arrangements of the applied load.

For members having symmetric cross sections, the fasteners and welds shall be arranged symmetrically about the axis of the member, or the total stresses including those due to eccentricity shall be included in the calculation of the stress range.

For axially loaded angle members where the center of gravity of the connecting welds lies between the line of the center of gravity of the angle cross section and the center of the connected leg, the effects of eccentricity shall be ignored. If the center of gravity of the connecting welds lies outside this zone, the total stresses, including those due to joint eccentricity, shall be included in the calculation of stress range.

#### 3.3. PLAIN MATERIAL AND WELDED JOINTS

In plain material and welded joints, the range of stress due to the applied cyclic loads shall not exceed the allowable stress range computed as follows.

(a) For stress categories A, B, B', C, D, E, and E', the allowable stress range,  $ F_{SR} $ , shall be determined by Equation A-3-1 or A-3-1M, as follows:

 $$ F_{SR}=1,000\Bigg(\frac{C_{f}}{n_{SR}}\Bigg)^{0.333}\geq F_{TH} $$ 

 $$ F_{SR}=6\ 900\Bigg(\frac{C_{f}}{n_{SR}}\Bigg)^{0.333}\geq F_{TH} $$ 

where

 $ C_{f} $  = constant from Table A-3.1 for the fatigue category

 $$ F_{SR} = allowable stress range, ksi (MPa) $$ 

 $ F_{TH}= $  threshold allowable stress range, maximum stress range for indefinite design life from Table A-3.1, ksi (MPa)

 $ n_{SR} $  = number of stress range fluctuations in design life

(b) For stress category F, the allowable stress range,  $ F_{SR} $ , shall be determined by Equation A-3-2 or A-3-2M as follows:

 $$ F_{SR}=100\Bigg(\frac{1.5}{n_{SR}}\Bigg)^{0.167}\geq8\mathrm{~ksi} $$ 

 $$ F_{SR}=690\Bigg(\frac{1.5}{n_{SR}}\Bigg)^{0.167}\geq55\ MPa $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_10/doc_3.md -->

(c) For tension-loaded plate elements connected at their end by cruciform, T-, or corner-joint details with partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welds transverse to the direction of stress, with or without reinforcing or contouring fillet welds, or if joined with only fillet welds, the allowable stress range on the cross section of the tension-loaded plate element shall be determined as the lesser of the following:

(1) Based upon crack initiation from the toe of the weld on the tension-loaded plate element (i.e., when  $ R_{PJP}=1.0 $ ), the allowable stress range,  $ F_{SR} $ , shall be determined by Equation A-3-1 or A-3-1M for stress category C.

(2) Based upon crack initiation from the root of the weld, the allowable stress range,  $ F_{SR} $ , on the tension loaded plate element using transverse PJP groove welds, with or without reinforcing or contouring fillet welds, the allowable stress range on the cross section at the root of the weld shall be determined by Equation A-3-3 or A-3-3M for stress category  $ C' $  as follows:

 $$ F_{SR}=1,000R_{PJP}\left(\frac{4.4}{n_{SR}}\right)^{0.333} $$ 

 $$ F_{SR}=6\;900R_{PJP}\left(\frac{4.4}{n_{SR}}\right)^{0.333} $$ 

where

 $ R_{PJP} $ , the reduction factor for reinforced or nonreinforced transverse PJP groove welds, is determined as follows:

 $$ R_{PJP}=\frac{0.65-0.59\left(\frac{2a}{t_{p}}\right)+0.72\left(\frac{w}{t_{p}}\right)}{t_{p}^{0.167}}\leq1.0 $$ 

 $$ R_{PJP}=\frac{1.12-1.01\left(\frac{2a}{t_{p}}\right)+1.24\left(\frac{w}{t_{p}}\right)}{t_{p}^{0.167}}\leq1.0 $$ 

2a = length of the nonwelded root face in the direction of the thickness of the tension-loaded plate, in. (mm)

t p = thickness of tension loaded plate, in. (mm)

w = leg size of the reinforcing or contouring fillet, if any, in the direction of the thickness of the tension-loaded plate, in. (mm)

If  $ R_{PJP} = 1.0 $ , the stress range will be limited by the weld toe and stress category C will control.

(3) Based upon crack initiation from the roots of a pair of transverse fillet welds on opposite sides of the tension loaded plate element, the allowable stress range,  $ F_{SR} $ , on the cross section at the root of the welds shall be determined by Equation A-3-5 or A-3-5M, for stress category C" as follows:

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_10/doc_4.md -->

 $$ F_{SR}=1,000R_{FIL}\Bigg(\frac{4.4}{n_{SR}}\Bigg)^{0.333} $$ 

 $$ F_{SR}=6\;900R_{FIL}\Bigg(\frac{4.4}{n_{SR}}\Bigg)^{0.333} $$ 

where

 $ R_{FIL} $  = reduction factor for joints using a pair of transverse fillet welds only

 $$ \begin{aligned}R_{FIL}&=reduction factor for joint\\&\quad only\\&=\frac{0.06+0.72\left(w/t_{p}\right)}{t_{p}^{0.167}}\leq1.0\\&=\frac{0.103+1.24\left(w/t_{p}\right)}{t_{p}^{0.167}}\leq1.0\end{aligned} $$ 

If  $ R_{FIL} = 1.0 $ , the stress range will be limited by the weld toe and stress category C will control.

User Note: Stress categories  $ C^{\prime} $  and  $ C^{\prime\prime} $  are cases where the fatigue crack initiates in the root of the weld. These cases do not have a fatigue threshold and cannot be designed for an infinite life. Infinite life can be approximated by use of a very high cycle life such as  $ 2 \times 10^{8} $ . Alternatively, if the size of the weld is increased such that  $ R_{FIL} $  or  $ R_{PJP} $  is equal to 1.0, then the base metal controls, resulting in stress category C, where there is a fatigue threshold and the crack initiates at the toe of the weld.

#### 3.4. BOLTS AND THREADED PARTS

In bolts and threaded parts, the range of stress of the applied cyclic load shall not exceed the allowable stress range computed as follows.

(a) For mechanically fastened connections loaded in shear, the maximum range of stress in the connected material of the applied cyclic load shall not exceed the allowable stress range computed using Equation A-3-1 or A-3-1M, where  $ C_{f} $  and  $ F_{TH} $  are taken from Section 2 of Table A-3.1.

(b) For high-strength bolts, common bolts, threaded anchor rods, and hanger rods with cut, ground, or rolled threads, the maximum range of tensile stress on the net tensile area from applied axial load and moment plus load due to prying action shall not exceed the allowable stress range computed using Equation A-3-1 or A-3-1M, where  $ C_{f} $  and  $ F_{TH} $  are taken from Case 8.5 (stress category G). The net area in tension,  $ A_{t} $ , is given by Equation A-3-7 or A-3-7M.

 $$ A_{t}=\frac{\pi}{4}\Bigg(d_{b}-\frac{0.9743}{n}\Bigg)^{2} $$ 

 $$ A_{t}=\frac{\pi}{4}\big(d_{b}-0.9382p\big)^{2} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_10/doc_5.md -->

where

 $ d_{b} $  = nominal diameter (body or shank diameter), in. (mm)

n = threads per in. (per mm)

 $$ p = \text{pitch, in. per thread (mm per thread)} $$ 

For joints in which the material within the grip is not limited to steel or joints that are not tensioned to the requirements of Table J3.1 or J3.1M, all axial load and moment applied to the joint plus effects of any prying action shall be assumed to be carried exclusively by the bolts or rods.

For joints in which the material within the grip is limited to steel and which are pretensioned to the requirements of Table J3.1 or J3.1M, an analysis of the relative stiffness of the connected parts and bolts is permitted to be used to determine the tensile stress range in the pretensioned bolts due to the total applied cyclic load and moment, plus effects of any prying action. Alternatively, the stress range in the bolts shall be assumed to be equal to the stress on the net tensile area due to 20% of the absolute value of the applied cyclic axial load and moment from dead, live, and other loads.

User Note: Where provisions of this Specification differ from provisions of the RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts or the AWS Welding Code—Steel (AWS D1.1/D1.1M), the provisions of this Specification govern. Some differences between this Specification and the RCSC Specification related to fatigue are described in the Commentary.

#### 3.5. FABRICATION AND ERECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR FATIGUE

Longitudinal steel backing, if used, shall be continuous. If splicing of steel backing is required for long joints, the splice shall be made with a complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove weld, ground flush to permit a tight fit. If fillet welds are used to attach left-in-place longitudinal backing, they shall be continuous.

In transverse CJP groove welded T- and corner-joints, a reinforcing fillet weld, not less than  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) in size, shall be added at reentrant corners.

The surface roughness of thermally cut edges subjected to cyclic stress ranges, that include tension, shall not exceed  $ 1,000 \mu $ in. ( $ 25 \mu $ m), where Surface Texture, Surface Roughness, Waviness, and Lay (ASME B46.1) is the reference standard.

User Note: AWS Surface Roughness Guide for Oxygen Cutting (AWS C4.1-77) sample 3 may be used to evaluate compliance with this requirement.

Reentrant corners at cuts, copes, and weld access holes shall form a radius not less than the prescribed radius in Table A-3.1.

For transverse butt joints in regions of tensile stress, weld tabs shall be used to provide for cascading the weld termination outside the finished joint. End dams shall not be used. Weld tabs shall be removed and the end of the weld finished flush with the edge of the member.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_10/doc_6.md -->

Fillet welds subjected to cyclic loading normal to the outstanding legs of angles, or on the outer edges of end plates, shall have end returns around the corner for a distance not less than two times the weld size; the end return distance shall not exceed four times the weld size.

#### 3.6. NONDESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR FATIGUE

In the case of CJP groove welds, the maximum allowable stress range calculated by Equation A-3-1 or A-3-1M applies only to welds that have been radiographically or ultrasonically tested and meet the acceptance requirements of Structural Welding Code—Steel, AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.12.2 or clause 8.13.2.

# APPENDIX 4 STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS

This appendix provides criteria for the design and evaluation of structural steel components, systems, and frames for fire conditions. These criteria provide for the determination of the heat input, thermal expansion, and degradation in mechanical properties of materials at elevated temperatures that cause progressive decrease in strength and stiffness of structural components and systems at elevated temperatures.

User Note: Throughout this chapter, the term “elevated temperatures” refers to temperatures due to unintended fire exposure only.

The appendix is organized as follows:

4.1. General Provisions

4.2. Structural Design for Fire Conditions by Analysis

4.3. Design by Qualification Testing

User Note: Appendix 4 incorporates provisions reproduced with permission from the International Building Code; Standard Calculation Methods for Structural Fire Protection (ASCE/SEI/SFPE 29); Eurocode 3: Design of Steel Structures, Part 1.2: General Rules, Structural Fire Design; and Eurocode 4: Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Structures, Part 1.2: General Rules, Structural Fire Design. See the Commentary to Appendix 4 for a listing of the specific provisions reproduced with permission from each of these sources.

#### 4.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

The methods contained in this appendix provide regulatory evidence of compliance in accordance with the design applications outlined in this section.

### 1. Performance Objective

Structural components, members, and building frame systems shall be designed so as to maintain their load-bearing function during the design-basis fire and to satisfy other performance requirements specified for the building occupancy.

Deformation criteria shall be applied where the means of providing structural fire resistance, or the design criteria for fire barriers, requires evaluation of the deformation of the load-carrying structure.

Within the compartment of fire origin, forces and deformations from the design-basis fire shall not cause a breach of horizontal or vertical compartmentation.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_10/doc_28.md -->

### 2. Design by Engineering Analysis

The analysis methods in Section 4.2 are permitted to be used to document the anticipated performance of steel framing when subjected to design-basis fire scenarios. Methods in Section 4.2 provide evidence of compliance with performance objectives established in Section 4.1.1.

The analysis methods in Section 4.2 are permitted to be used to demonstrate an equivalency for an alternative material or method, as permitted by the applicable building code (ABC).

Structural design for fire conditions using Appendix 4.2 shall be performed using the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method in accordance with the provisions of Section B3.1, unless a design based on advanced analysis is performed in accordance with Section 4.2.4c. Ambient resistance factors shall be used with the LRFD method.

### 3. Design by Qualification Testing

The qualification testing methods in Section 4.3 are permitted to be used to document the fire resistance of steel framing subject to the standardized fire testing protocols required by the ABC.

### 4. Load Combinations and Required Strength

In the absence of ABC provisions for design under fire exposures, the required strength of the structure and its elements shall be determined from the gravity load combination as follows:

 $$ (0.9or1.2)D+A_{T}+0.5L+0.2S $$ 

where

 $ A_{T} $  = nominal forces and deformations due to the design-basis fire defined in Section 4.2.1

D = nominal dead load

 $$ L=nominal occupancy\ live\ load $$ 

 $$ S = nominal snow load $$ 

User Note: ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.5, contains Equation A-4-1 for extraordinary events, which includes fire. Live load reduction is usually considered in accordance with ASCE/SEI 7.

#### 4.2. STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS BY ANALYSIS

It is permitted to design structural members, components, and building frames for elevated temperatures in accordance with the requirements of this section.

### 1. Design-Basis Fire

A design-basis fire shall be identified to describe the heating and cooling conditions for the structure. These heating and cooling conditions shall relate to the fuel commodities and compartment characteristics present in the assumed fire area. The fuel

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_10/doc_29.md -->

load density based on the occupancy of the space shall be considered when determining the total fuel load. Heating and cooling conditions shall be specified either in terms of a heat flux or temperature of the upper gas layer created by the fire. The variation of the heating and cooling conditions with time shall be determined for the duration of the fire.

The analysis methods in Section 4.2 shall be used in accordance with the provisions for alternative materials, designs, and methods as permitted by the ABC. When the analysis methods in Section 4.2 are used to demonstrate equivalency to hourly ratings based on qualification testing in Section 4.3, the design-basis fire is permitted to be determined in accordance with ASTM E119 or ANSI/UL 263.

### 1 a. Localized Fire

Where the heat release rate from the fire is insufficient to cause flashover, a localized fire exposure shall be assumed. In such cases, the fuel composition, arrangement of the fuel array, and floor area occupied by the fuel shall be used to determine the radiant heat flux from the flame and smoke plume to the structure.

### 1 b. Post-Flashover Compartment Fires

Where the heat release rate from the fire is sufficient to cause flashover, a post-flashover compartment fire shall be assumed. The determination of the temperature versus time profile resulting from the fire shall include fuel load, ventilation characteristics of the space (natural and mechanical), compartment dimensions, and thermal characteristics of the compartment boundary.

The fire duration in a particular area shall be determined from the total combustible mass or fuel load in the space. In the case of either a localized fire or a post-flashover compartment fire, the fire duration shall be determined as the total combustible mass divided by the mass loss rate.

### 1 c. Exterior Fires

The exposure effects of the exterior structure to flames projecting from windows or other wall openings as a result of a post-flashover compartment fire shall be addressed along with the radiation from the interior fire through the opening. The shape and length of the flame projection shall be used along with the distance between the flame and the exterior steelwork to determine the heat flux to the steel. The method identified in Section 4.2.1b shall be used for describing the characteristics of the interior compartment fire.

### 1 d. Active Fire-Protection Systems

The effects of active fire-protection systems shall be addressed when describing the design-basis fire.

Where automatic smoke and heat vents are installed in nonsprinklered spaces, the resulting smoke temperature shall be determined from calculation.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_0.md -->

### 2. Temperatures in Structural Systems Under Fire Conditions

Temperatures within structural members, components, and frames due to the heating conditions posed by the design-basis fire shall be determined by a heat transfer analysis.

### 3. Material Properties at Elevated Temperatures

The effects of elevated temperatures on the physical and mechanical properties of materials shall be considered in the analysis and design of structural members, components, and systems. Any rational method that establishes material properties at elevated temperatures that is based on test data is permitted, including the methods defined in Sections 4.2.3a and 4.2.3b.

### 3 a. Thermal Elongation

The coefficients of thermal expansion shall be taken to be as follows.

(a) For structural and reinforcing steels: For calculations at temperatures above  $ 150^{\circ} $ F ( $ 66^{\circ} $ C), the coefficient of thermal expansion is  $ 7.8 \times 10^{-6}/^{\circ} $ F ( $ 1.4 \times 10^{-5}/^{\circ} $ C).

(b) For normal weight concrete: For calculations at temperatures above  $ 150^{\circ} $ F ( $ 66^{\circ} $ C), the coefficient of thermal expansion is  $ 10 \times 10^{-6}/^{\circ} $ F ( $ 1.8 \times 10^{-5}/^{\circ} $ C).

(c) For lightweight concrete: For calculations at temperatures above  $ 150^{\circ} $ F ( $ 66^{\circ} $ C), the coefficient of thermal expansion is  $ 4.4 \times 10^{-6}/^{\circ} $ F ( $ 7.9 \times 10^{-6}/^{\circ} $ C).

### 3 b. Mechanical Properties of Structural Steel, Hot-Rolled Reinforcing Steel, and Concrete at Elevated Temperatures

The uniaxial engineering stress-strain-temperature relationship for structural steel, hot-rolled reinforcing steel, and concrete shall be determined using this section. This applies only to structural and reinforcing steels with a specified minimum yield strength,  $ F_{y} $ , equal to 65 ksi (450 MPa) or less, and to concrete with a specified compressive strength,  $ f_{c}^{\prime} $ , equal to 8 ksi (55 MPa) or less.

## (a) Structural and hot-rolled reinforcing steel

Table A-4.2.1 provides retention factors,  $ k_{E} $ ,  $ k_{p} $ , and  $ k_{y} $ , for steel which are expressed as the ratio of the mechanical property at elevated temperature with respect to the property at ambient, assumed to be  $ 68^{\circ}F $  ( $ 20^{\circ}C $ ). It is permitted to interpolate between these values. The properties at elevated temperature, T, are defined as follows:

 $ G(T) $  is the shear modulus of elasticity of steel at elevated temperature, ksi (MPa), which is calculated as the retention factor,  $ k_{E} $ , times the ambient property as specified in Table A-4.2.1.

 $ F_{y}(T) $  is the specified minimum yield stress of steel at elevated temperature, ksi (MPa), which is calculated as the retention factor,  $ k_{y} $ , times the ambient property as specified in Table A-4.2.1.

 $ F_{p}(T) $  is the proportional limit at elevated temperature, which is calculated as the retention factor,  $ k_{p} $ , times the yield strength as specified in Table A-4.2.1.

 $ F_{u}(T) $  is the specified minimum tensile strength at elevated temperature, which is equal to  $ F_{y}(T) $  for temperatures greater than  $ 750^{\circ}F $  ( $ 400^{\circ}C $ ).

## (b) Concrete

Table A-4.2.2 provides retention factors,  $ k_{c} $  and  $ k_{E_{c}} $ , for concrete which are expressed as the ratio of the mechanical property at elevated temperature with respect to the property at ambient, assumed to be  $ 68^{\circ}F $  ( $ 20^{\circ}C $ ).

 $$ F_{c}\left(T\right)=f_{c}^{\prime}\left(T\right)\left\{\frac{3\left[\frac{\varepsilon_{c}\left(T\right)}{\varepsilon_{cu}\left(T\right)}\right]}{2+\left[\frac{\varepsilon_{c}\left(T\right)}{\varepsilon_{cu}\left(T\right)}\right]^{3}}\right\} $$ 

where  $  F_{c}(T)  $  and  $  \varepsilon_{c}(T)  $  are the concrete compressive stress and strain, respectively, at elevated temperature.

User Note: The tensile strength of concrete at elevated temperature can be taken as zero, or not more than 10% of the compressive strength at the corresponding temperature.

## (c) Strengths of bolts at elevated temperatures

Table A-4.2.3 provides the retention factor,  $ k_{b} $ , for high-strength bolts that is expressed as the ratio of the mechanical property at elevated temperature with respect to the property at ambient, which is assumed to be  $ 68^{\circ}F $  ( $ 20^{\circ}C $ ).

### 4. Structural Design Requirements

### 4 a. General Requirements

The structural frame and foundation shall be capable of providing the strength and deformation capacity to withstand, as a system, the structural actions developed during the fire within the prescribed limits of deformation. The structural system shall be designed to sustain local damage with the structural system as a whole remaining stable. Frame stability and required strength shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of Section C1.

Continuous load paths shall be provided to transfer all forces from the exposed region to the final point of resistance.

The size and spacing of vent holes in filled composite members shall be evaluated such that no applicable strength limit states in the steel elements are exceeded due

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_5.md -->

to the build-up of steam pressure. Any rational method that considers heat transfer through the cross section, water content in concrete, fire protection, and the allowable pressure build up in the member is permitted for calculating the size and spacing of vent holes.

User Note: Section 4.3.2b(a) provides a possible vent hole configuration for filled composite columns.

### 4 b. Strength Requirements and Deformation Limits

Conformance of the structural system to these requirements shall be demonstrated by constructing a mathematical model of the structure based on principles of structural mechanics and evaluating this model for the internal forces and deformations in the members of the structure developed by the temperatures from the design-basis fire.

Individual members shall have the design strength necessary to resist the shears, axial forces, and moments determined in accordance with these provisions.

Structural components shall be designed and detailed to resist the imposed loading and deformation demands during a design-basis fire as required to meet the performance objectives stated in Section 4.1.1. Where the means of providing fire resistance requires the evaluation of deformation criteria, the deformation of the structural system, or members thereof, under the design-basis fire shall not exceed the prescribed limits.

User Note: Typical simple shear connections may need additional design enhancements for ductility and resistance to large compression and tensile forces that may develop during the design-basis fire exposure. A fire exposure will not only affect the magnitude of member end reactions, but may also change the limit state to one different from the controlling mode at ambient temperature.

It is permitted to include membrane action of composite floor slabs for fire resistance if the design provides for the effects of increased connection tensile forces and redistributed gravity load demands on the adjacent framing supports.

### 4 c. Design by Advanced Methods of Analysis

Design by advanced methods of analysis is permitted for the design of all steel building structures for fire conditions. The design-basis fire exposure shall be that determined in Section 4.2.1. The analysis shall include both a thermal response and the mechanical response to the design-basis fire.

The thermal response shall produce a temperature field in each structural element as a result of the design-basis fire and shall incorporate temperature-dependent thermal properties of the structural elements and fire-resistive materials, as per Section 4.2.2.

The mechanical response shall include the forces and deformations in the structural system due to the thermal response calculated from the design-basis fire. The

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_6.md -->

mechanical response shall take into account explicitly the deterioration in strength and stiffness with increasing temperature, the effects of thermal expansions, inelastic behavior and load redistribution, large deformations, time-dependent effects such as creep, and uncertainties resulting from variability in material properties at elevated temperature. Support and restraint conditions (forces, moments, and boundary conditions) shall represent the behavior of the structure during a design-basis fire. Material properties shall be defined as per Section 4.2.3.

The resulting analysis shall address all relevant limit states, such as excessive deflections, connection ruptures, and global and local buckling, and shall demonstrate an adequate level of safety as required by the authority having jurisdiction.

### 4 d. Design by Simple Methods of Analysis

The methods of analysis in this section are permitted to be used for the evaluation of the performance of structural components and frames at elevated temperatures during exposure to a design-basis fire.

When evaluating structural components, the stiffnesses and boundary conditions applicable at ambient temperatures are permitted to be assumed to remain unchanged throughout the fire exposure for the calculation of required strengths.

For evaluating the performance of structural frames during exposure to a design-basis fire, the required strengths are also permitted to be determined through consideration of reduced stiffness at elevated temperatures, boundary conditions, and thermal deformations.

User Note: Determining the required strength assuming ambient temperatures throughout the fire exposure is generally applicable to members in regular gravity frames. Determining the required strength accounting for elevated temperatures may be more appropriate for irregular structural frames.

The design strength shall be determined as in Section B3.1. The nominal strength,  $ R_{n} $ , shall be calculated using material properties, as provided in Section 4.2.3b, at the temperature developed by the design-basis fire and as stipulated in Sections 4.2.4d(a) through (h).

The simple method is only applicable to members with nonslender and/or compact sections.

It is permitted to model the thermal response of steel and composite members using a lumped heat capacity analysis with heat input as determined by the design-basis fire defined in Section 4.2.1, using the temperature equal to the maximum steel temperature. For composite beams, the maximum steel temperature shall be assigned to the bottom flange and a temperature gradient shall be applied to incorporate thermally induced moments as stipulated in Section 4.2.4d(f).

For steel temperatures less than or equal to  $ 400^{\circ} $ F ( $ 200^{\circ} $ C), the member and connection design strengths are permitted to be determined without consideration of temperature effects on the nominal strengths.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_7.md -->

User Note: Lumped heat capacity analysis assumes uniform temperature over the section and length of the member, which is generally a reasonable assumption for many structural members exposed to post-flashover fires. Consideration should be given to the use of the uniform temperature assumption as it may not always be applicable or conservative.

The simple methods of analysis are not intended for temperatures below  $ 400^{\circ} $ F ( $ 200^{\circ} $ C). The nominal strengths for temperatures below  $ 400^{\circ} $ F ( $ 200^{\circ} $ C) should be calculated without any consideration of temperature effects on material properties or member behavior.

## (a) Design for tension

The nominal strength for tension shall be determined using the provisions of Chapter D, with steel properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b(a) and assuming a uniform temperature over the cross section using the temperature equal to the maximum steel temperature.

## (b) Design for compression

For nonslender-element columns, the nominal strength for flexural buckling of compression members shall be determined using the provisions of Chapter E with steel properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b(a). Equation A-4-9 shall be used in lieu of Equations E3-2 and E3-3 to calculate the nominal compressive strength for flexural buckling:

 $$ F_{n}\left(T\right)=\left\lbrack0.42^{\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}\left(T\right)}{F_{e}\left(T\right)}}}\right\rbrack F_{y}\left(T\right) $$ 

where  $ F_{y}(T) $  is the yield stress at elevated temperature and  $ F_{e}(T) $  is the critical elastic buckling stress calculated from Equation E3-4 with the elastic modulus,  $ E(T) $ , at elevated temperature.  $ F_{y}(T) $  and  $ E(T) $  are obtained using coefficients from Table A-4.2.1.

The strength of gravity-only columns that do not provide resistance to lateral loads is permitted to be increased by the rotational restraints from cooler columns in the stories above and below the story exposed to the fire. This increased strength applies to fires on only one floor and should not be used for multiple story fires. It is permitted to account for the increase in design strength by reducing the column slenderness,  $ L_{c}/r $ , used to calculate  $ F_{e}(T) $  in Equation A-4-9 to  $ L_{c}(T)/r $  as follows:

 $$ \frac{L_{c}(T)}{r}=\left[1-\frac{T-32}{n\left(3,600\right)}\right]\frac{L_{c}}{r}-\frac{35}{n\left(3,600\right)}\big(T-32\big)\geq0,\ \text{℉} $$ 

 $$ \frac{L_{c}(T)}{r}=\left[1-\frac{T}{n\left(2\ 000\right)}\right]\frac{L_{c}}{r}-\frac{35T}{n\left(2\ 000\right)}\geq0,\ ^\circ C $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_8.md -->

where

 $ L_{c} $  = effective length of member, in. (mm)

 $$ =KL $$ 

K = 1.0 for gravity-only columns

L = laterally unbraced length of the member, in. (mm)

T = temperature of structural steel, °F (°C)

n = 1 for columns with cooler columns both above and below

n = 2 for columns with cooler columns either above or below only

 $$ r = \text{radius of gyration, in. (mm)} $$ 

User Note: The design equations for compression predict flexural buckling capacities of wide-flange rolled shapes, but do not consider local buckling and torsional buckling. If applicable, these additional limit states must be considered with an alternative method. For most fire conditions, uniform heating and temperatures govern the design for compression. When uniform heating is not a reasonable assumption, alternative methods must be used to account for the effects of nonuniform heating and resulting thermal gradients on the design strength of compression members, as the simple method assumes a uniform temperature distribution.

## (c) Design for compression in filled composite columns

For filled composite columns, the nominal strength for compression shall be determined using the provisions of Section I2.2 with steel and concrete properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b. Equation A-4-11 shall be used in lieu of Equations I2-2 and I2-3 to calculate the nominal compressive strength for flexural buckling:

 $$ P_{n}\left(T\right)=\left\{0.54^{\left[\frac{P_{no}\left(T\right)}{P_{e}\left(T\right)}\right]^{0.3}}\right\}P_{no}\left(T\right) $$ 

where  $ P_{no}(T) $  is calculated at elevated temperature using Equations I2-9, I2-10, and I2-11.  $ P_{e}(T) $  is calculated at elevated temperature using Equation I2-4.  $ EI_{eff}(T) $  is calculated at elevated temperature using Equations I2-12 and I2-13.  $ F_{y}(T) $ ,  $ f_{c}^{\prime}(T) $ ,  $ E_{s}(T) $ , and  $ E_{c}(T) $  are obtained using coefficients from Tables A-4.2.1 and A-4.2.2.

## (d) Design for compression in filled composite plate shear walls

For filled composite plate shear walls, the nominal strength for compression shall be determined using the provisions of Section I2.3 with steel and concrete properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b and Equation A-4-12 used in lieu of Equations I2-2 and I2-3 to calculate the nominal compressive strength for flexural buckling:

 $$ P_{n}\left(T\right)=\left\{0.32^{\left[\frac{P_{no}\left(T\right)}{P_{e}\left(T\right)}\right]^{0.3}}\right\}P_{no}\left(T\right) $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_9.md -->

where  $ P_{no}(T) $  is calculated at elevated temperature using Equation I2-15.  $ P_{e}(T) $  is calculated at elevated temperature using Equation I2-4.  $ EI_{eff}(T) $  is calculated at elevated temperatures using Equation I1-1.  $ F_{y}(T) $ ,  $ f_{c}^{\prime}(T) $ ,  $ E_{s}(T) $ , and  $ E_{c}(T) $  are obtained using coefficients from Tables A-4.2.1 and A-4.2.2.

User Note: For composite members, the steel temperature is determined using heat transfer equations with heat input corresponding to the design-basis fire. The temperature distribution in concrete infill can be calculated using one- or two-dimensional heat transfer equations. The regions of concrete infill will have varying temperatures and mechanical properties. Concrete contribution to axial strength and effective stiffness can therefore be calculated by discretizing the cross section into smaller elements (with each concrete element considered to have a uniform temperature) and summing up the contribution of individual elements.

## (e) Design for flexure

For steel beams, the temperature over the depth of the member shall be taken as the temperature calculated for the bottom flange.

The nominal strength for flexure shall be determined using the provisions of Chapter F with steel properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b(a). Equations A-4-13 through A-4-19 shall be used in lieu of Equations F2-2 through F2-8 to calculate the nominal flexural strength for lateral-torsional buckling of doubly symmetric compact rolled wide-flange shapes bent about their major axis.

(1) When  $ L_{b} \leq L_{r}(T) $

The material properties at elevated temperatures,  $ E(T) $  and  $ F_{y}(T) $ , and the retention factors,  $ k_{p} $  and  $ k_{y} $ , are calculated in accordance with Table A-4.2.1, and other terms are as defined in Chapter F.

User Note:  $ F_{L}(T) $  represents the initial yield stress, which assumes a residual stress of  $ 0.3F_{y} $ . Alternatively, 10 ksi (69 MPa) may be used in place of  $ 0.3F_{y} $  for calculation of  $ F_{L}(T) $ .

User Note: The equations for lateral-torsional buckling do not consider local buckling. If applicable, the effects of local buckling must be considered with an alternative method.

## (f) Design for flexure in composite beams

For composite beams, the calculated bottom flange temperature shall be taken as constant between the bottom flange and mid-depth of the web and shall decrease linearly by no more than 25% from the mid-depth of the web to the top flange of the beam.

The nominal strength of a composite flexural member shall be determined using the provisions of Chapter I, with reduced yield stresses in the steel as determined from Table A-4.2.1. Steel properties will vary as the temperature along the depth of section changes.

Alternatively, the nominal flexural strength of a composite beam,  $ M_{n}(T) $ , is permitted to be calculated using the bottom flange temperature, T, as follows:

 $$ M_{n}(T)=k_{cb}M_{n} $$ 

where

 $ M_{n} $  = nominal flexural strength at ambient temperature calculated in accordance with provisions of Chapter I, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ k_{cb}= $  retention factor depending on bottom flange temperature, T, as given in Table A-4.2.4

## (g) Design for shear

The nominal strength for shear yielding shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter G, with steel properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b(a) and assuming a uniform temperature over the cross section.

User Note: Shear yielding equations do not consider shear buckling or tension field action. If applicable, these limit states must be considered with an alternative method.

## (h) Design for combined forces and torsion

The nominal strength for combinations of axial force and flexure about one or both axes, with or without torsion, shall be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter H with the design axial, flexural, and shear strengths as stipulated in Sections 4.2.4d(a), (b), (e), and (g). Nominal strength for torsion shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter H, with the steel properties as stipulated in Section 4.2.3b(a), assuming uniform temperature over the cross section.

### 4 e. Design by Critical Temperature Method

The critical temperature of a structural member is the temperature at which the demand on the member exceeds its capacity under fire conditions. The temperature of a loaded structural member exposed to the design-basis fire defined in Section 4.2.1 shall not exceed the critical temperature as calculated in this section. The evaluation methods in this section are permitted to be used in lieu of Section 4.2.4d for tension members, continuously braced beams not supporting concrete slabs, or compression members that are assumed to be simply supported and develop a uniform temperature over the cross section throughout the fire exposure.

The use of the critical temperature method shall be limited to steel members with wide-flange rolled shapes that have nonslender elements per Section B4.

## (a) Design for tensile yielding

The critical temperature of a tension member is permitted to be calculated as follows:

 $$ T_{cr}=816-306\ln\left(\frac{R_{u}}{R_{n}}\right)in~^{\circ}F $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_12.md -->

 $$ T_{cr}=435-170\ln\left(\frac{R_{u}}{R_{n}}\right)in\text{℃} $$ 

where

 $ R_{n} $  = nominal yielding strength at ambient temperature determined in accordance with Section D2, kips (N)

 $ R_{u}= $  required tensile strength at elevated temperature, determined using the load combination in Equation A-4-1 and greater than  $ 0.01R_{n} $ , kips (N)

 $ T_{cr}= $  critical temperature in °F (°C)

User Note: Tensile rupture in the net section is not considered in this critical temperature calculation. It can be considered using an alternative method.

## (b) Design for compression

The critical temperature of a compression member for flexural buckling is permitted to be calculated as follows:

 $$ T_{cr}=1580-0.814\Bigg(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\Bigg)-1300\Bigg(\frac{P_{u}}{P_{n}}\Bigg)\mathrm{in}\mathrm{\text{~}^{\circ}F} $$ 

 $$ T_{cr}=858-0.455\Bigg(\frac{L_{c}}{r}\Bigg)-722\Bigg(\frac{P_{u}}{P_{n}}\Bigg)\mathrm{~in~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C} $$ 

where

 $ P_{n} $  = nominal compressive strength at ambient temperature determined in accordance with the provisions in Section E3, kips (N)

 $ P_{u}= $  required compressive strength at elevated temperature, determined using the load combination in Equation A-4-1, kips (N)

## (c) Design for flexural yielding

The critical temperature of a continuously braced beam not supporting a concrete slab is permitted to be calculated as follows:

 $$ T_{cr}=816-306\ln\left(\frac{M_{u}}{M_{n}}\right)in^{\circ}F $$ 

 $$ T_{cr}=435-170\ln\left(\frac{M_{u}}{M_{n}}\right)in^{\circ}C $$ 

where

 $ M_{n}= $  nominal flexural strength due to yielding at ambient temperature determined in accordance with the provisions in Section F2.1, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{u}= $  required flexural strength at elevated temperature, determined using the load combination in Equation A-4-1 and greater than  $ 0.01M_{n} $ , kip-in. (N-mm)

 $$ T_{cr}=critical temperature in\ ^{\circ}F\ (^{\circ}C) $$

User Note: Lateral-torsional buckling of beams is not considered in this critical temperature calculation. It can be considered using an alternative method.

#### 4.3. DESIGN BY QUALIFICATION TESTING

### 1. Qualification Standards

Structural members and components in steel buildings shall be qualified for the rating period in conformance with ASTM E119 or ANSI/UL 263. Demonstration of compliance with these requirements using the procedures specified for steel construction in Section 5 of Standard Calculation Methods for Structural Fire Protection (ASCE/SEI/SFPE 29) is permitted. It is also permitted to demonstrate equivalency to such standard fire-resistance ratings using the advanced analysis methods in Section 4.2 in combination with the fire exposure specified in ASTM E119 or ANSI/UL 263 as the design-basis fire.

User Note: There are other standard fire exposures that are more severe than that prescribed in ASTM E119, for example the hydrocarbon pool fire scenario defined in ASTM E1529 (UL 1709). Fire-resistance ratings developed on the basis of ASTM E119 are not directly substitutable for such more demanding conditions.

The generic steel assemblies described in Table A-4.3.1 shall be deemed to have the fire-resistance ratings prescribed therein.

### 2. Structural Steel Assemblies

The provisions of this section contain procedures by which the standard fire-resistance ratings of structural steel assemblies are established by calculations. Use of these provisions is permitted in place of and/or as a supplement to published fire-resistive assemblies based on ASTM E119 or ANSI/UL 263. The installation of the fire-protection material shall comply with the applicable requirements of the building code, the referenced approved assemblies, and manufacturer instructions.

The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios, W/D, and area-to-heated-perimeter ratios, A/P, shall be determined in accordance with the definitions given in this section. As used in these sections, W is the average weight of a shape in pounds per linear foot and A is the area in square inches. The heated perimeter, D or P, is the inside perimeter of the fire-resistant material or exterior contour of the steel shape in inches, as defined for each type of member.

### 2 a. Steel Columns

The fire-resistance ratings of columns shall be based on the size of the member and the type of protection provided in accordance with this section.

The application of these procedures for noncomposite steel column assemblies shall be limited to designs in which the fire-resistant material is not designed to carry any of the load acting on the column.

Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing elements shall not be embedded in required fire-resistant materials, unless fire-endurance test results are available to establish the adequacy of the resulting condition.

User Note: The International Building Code requires fire-resistance-rated columns to be protected on all sides for the full column height, including connections with other structural members and protection continuity through any ceilings to the top of the column.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_21.md -->

## (a) Gypsum wallboard protection

The fire resistance of columns with weight-to-heated perimeter ratios, W/D, less than or equal to 3.65 lb/ft/in. (0.21 kg/m/mm) and protected with Type X gypsum wallboard is permitted to be determined from the following expression for a maximum column rating of 4 hours:

 $$ R=130\left[\frac{h\left(\frac{W^{\prime}}{D}\right)}{2}\right]^{0.75} $$ 

 $$ R=96\left[\frac{h\left(\frac{W^{\prime}}{D}\right)}{2}\right]^{0.75} $$ 

where

D = inside heated perimeter of the gypsum board, in. (mm)

 $$ R = \text{fire resistance}, \text{min} $$ 

 $$  W = \text{nominal weight of steel shape, lb/ft (kg/m)}  $$ 

 $ W' = total weight of steel shape and gypsum wallboard protection, lb/ft (kg/m) $ 

h = total nominal thickness of Type X gypsum wallboard, in. (mm)

and

 $$ \frac{W^{\prime}}{D}=\frac{W}{D}+\frac{50h}{144} $$ 

 $$ \frac{W^{\prime}}{D}=\frac{W}{D}+0.0008h $$ 

For columns with weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios, W/D, greater than 3.65 lb/ft/in. (0.21 kg/m/mm), the thickness of Type X gypsum wallboard required for specified fire-resistance ratings shall be the same as the thickness determined for W/D = 3.65 lb/ft/in. (0.21 kg/m/mm).

User Note: This equation has been developed and long used for steel column fire protection with any Type X gypsum board. Because Type C gypsum board has demonstrated improved fire performance relative to Type X board, these provisions may also be conservatively applied to column protection with any Type C gypsum board. The supporting test data and accompanying gypsum board installation methods limit the computed fire-resistance rating of the steel column to a maximum of 3 hours or 4 hours, as specified in the next section.

The gypsum board or gypsum panel products shall be installed and supported as required either in ANSI/UL 263, Design No. X526, for fire-resistance ratings of four hours or less, or in ANSI/UL 263, Design No. X528, for fire-resistance ratings of three hours or less.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_22.md -->

User Note: The attachment of the Type X gypsum board protection for the steel columns must be done in accordance with the referenced UL assemblies. UL X526 is applicable only when exterior steel covers are installed over the gypsum board; otherwise, ANSI/UL 263, Design No. X528, describes the more general gypsum board installation.

## (b) Sprayed and intumescent or mastic fire-resistant materials

The fire resistance of columns protected with sprayed or intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings shall be determined on the basis of standard fire-resistance-rated assemblies, any associated computations, and limits as provided in the applicable rated assemblies.

The fire resistance of wide-flange columns protected with sprayed fire-resistant materials is permitted to be determined as follows:

 $$ R=\left[C_{1}\left(\frac{W}{D}\right)+C_{2}\right]h $$ 

 $$ R=\left[C_{3}\left(\frac{W}{D}\right)+C_{4}\right]h $$ 

where

 $ C_{1} $ ,  $ C_{2} $ ,  $ C_{3} $ , and  $ C_{4} $  = material-dependent constants prescribed in specified rated assembly

= heated perimeter of the column, in. (mm)

 $$ R $$ 

 $$ =fire resistance,min $$ 

 $$ W $$ 

 $$ =weight of columns,lb/ft(kg/m) $$ 

 $$ h $$ 

= thickness of sprayed fire-resistant material, in. (mm)

The material-dependent constants,  $ C_{1} $ ,  $ C_{2} $ ,  $ C_{3} $ , and  $ C_{4} $ , shall be determined for specific fire-resistant materials on the basis of standard fire endurance tests. The computational usage for each correlation, protection product, and its material-dependent constants shall be limited to the range of their underlying fire test basis reflected in the selected rated assembly.

User Note: The fire-resistance-rated steel column assemblies, published by UL and by other test laboratories, will often include such interpolation equations and specific constants that depend on the particular fire-protection product. The applicability limits of each given design correlation relative to the column assembly, sprayed fire-resistant protection product, W/D, rating duration, minimum required thickness, and similar properties, must be followed to remain within the range of the existing fire test data range.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_23.md -->

The fire resistance of HSS columns protected with sprayed fire-resistant materials is permitted to be determined from empirical correlations similar to Equation A-4-25 and A-4-25M expressed in terms of A/P values, where A is the area in  $ \mathrm{in}^{2} $  ( $ mm^{2} $ ) and P is the heated perimeter. The applicability limits specified in the rated column assembly for each correlation and its material-dependent constants shall be followed.

## (c) Noncomposite columns encased in concrete

The fire resistance of noncomposite columns fully encased within concrete protection is permitted to be determined from the following expression:

 $$ R=R_{o}\left(1+0.03m\right) $$ 

where

 $$ R_{o}\quad=10\Bigg(\frac{W}{D}\Bigg)^{0.7}+17\frac{h^{1.6}}{K_{c}^{0.2}}\Bigg\{1+26\Bigg[\frac{H}{p_{c}c_{c}h\big(L+h\big)}\Bigg]^{0.8}\Bigg\} $$ 

 $$ R_{o}\quad=73\Bigg(\frac{W}{D}\Bigg)^{0.7}+0.162\frac{h^{1.6}}{K_{c}^{0.2}}\Bigg\{1+31000\Bigg[\frac{H}{p_{c}c_{c}h\big(L+h\big)}\Bigg]^{0.8}\Bigg\} $$ 

D = heated perimeter of the column, in. (mm)

 $$  H = \text{ambient temperature thermal capacity of the steel column, Btu/ft-°F}  $$ 

 $$  (kJ/m-K)  $$ 

 $$  = 0.11W (0.46W)  $$ 

 $ K_{c} $  = ambient temperature thermal conductivity of the concrete, Btu/hr-ft- $ ^{\circ} $ F (W/m-K)

L = interior dimension of one side of a square concrete box protection, in. (mm)

 $$  R = \text{fire endurance at equilibrium moisture conditions, min}  $$ 

 $$ R_{o} = fire endurance at zero moisture content, \min $$ 

 $$ W = \text{average weight of the column, lb/ft (kg/m)} $$ 

 $$ c_{c}=ambient temperature specific heat of concrete,Btu/lb-^{\circ}F(kJ/kg-K) $$ 

h = thickness of the concrete cover, measured between the exposed concrete and nearest outer surface of the encased steel column section, in. (mm)

m = equilibrium moisture content of the concrete by volume, %

 $$ p_{c} = concrete density, lb/ft^{3} (kg/m^{3}) $$ 

When the inside perimeter of the concrete protection is not square, L shall be taken as the average of its two rectangular side lengths  $ (L_{1} $  and  $ L_{2}) $ . If the thickness of the concrete cover is not constant, h shall be taken as the average of  $ h_{1} $  and  $ h_{2} $ .

User Note: The variables in these equations are illustrated in the following figures.

<div style="text-align: center;">(c) Concrete-encased wide-flange shape</div>


For wide-flange columns completely encased in concrete with all reentrant spaces filled, the thermal capacity of the concrete within the reentrant spaces is permitted to be added to the ambient thermal capacity of the steel column, as follows:

 $$ H=0.11W+\left(\frac{p_{c}c_{c}}{144}\right)\left(b_{f}d-A_{s}\right) $$ 

 $$ H=0.46W+\left(\frac{p_{c}c_{c}}{1000\ 000}\right)\left(b_{f}d-A_{s}\right) $$ 

where

 $ A_{s}= $  area of the steel column, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

$b_{f} = \mathrm{width}$ of the column flange, in. (mm)

 $$ d = \text{depth of the column, in. (mm)} $$ 

User Note: It is conservative to neglect this additional concrete term in the column fire-resistance calculation.

In the absence of more specific data for the ambient properties of the concrete encasement, it is permitted to use the values provided in Table A-4.3.2.

User Note: The estimated free moisture content of concrete given in Table A-4.3.2 may not be appropriate for all conditions, particularly for older concrete that has already been in service for a longer time. For these and similar situations of uncertainty, it is conservative to not rely on this beneficial effect of the free moisture and to assume the concrete is completely dry with m=0 for fire resistance of  $ R=R_{o} $ .

## (d) Noncomposite columns encased in masonry units of concrete or clay

The fire resistance of noncomposite columns protected by encasement with concrete masonry units or with clay masonry units is permitted to be determined from the following expression:

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_11/doc_25.md -->

 $$ R=0.17\Bigg(\frac{W}{D}\Bigg)^{0.7}+\Bigg[0.285\Bigg(\frac{T_{e}^{1.6}}{K_{c}^{0.2}}\Bigg)\Bigg]\Bigg\{1.0+42.7\Bigg[\frac{\Big(A_{s}/d_{m}T_{e}\Big)}{\Big(0.25p+T_{e}\Big)}\Bigg]^{0.8}\Bigg\} $$ 

 $$ R=1.22\Bigg(\frac{W}{D}\Bigg)^{0.7}+\Bigg[0.0027\Bigg(\frac{T_{e}^{1.6}}{K_{c}^{0.2}}\Bigg)\Bigg]\Bigg\{1.0+1.249\Bigg[\frac{\Big(A_{s}/\boldsymbol{d}_{m}T_{e}\Big)}{\Big(0.25p+T_{e}\Big)}\Bigg]^{0.8}\Bigg\}\mathrm{(A-4-30M)} $$ 

where

 $$ A_{s}=\mathrm{cross-sectional~area~of~column,~in.}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right) $$ 

D = heated perimeter of column, in. (mm)

 $ K_{c} $  = thermal conductivity of concrete or clay masonry unit, Btu/hr-ft-°F (W/m-K) (see Table A-4.3.3)

R = fire-resistance rating of column assembly, hr

 $ T_{e} $  = equivalent thickness of concrete or clay masonry unit, in accordance with ACI 216.1, in. (mm)

 $$ W=\text{average weight of column, lb/ft (kg/m)} $$ 

 $$ d_{m}=\mathrm{d e n s i t y~o f~t h e~c o n c r e t e~o r~c l a y~m a s o n r y~u n i t,~l b/f t^{3}~(k g/m^{3})} $$ 

p = inner perimeter of concrete or clay masonry protection, in. (mm)

The thermal conductivity values given in Table A-4.3.3 as a function of the concrete or clay masonry unit density is permitted for use with this encasement protection formulation.

User Note: Equations A-4-30 and A-4-30M are derived from Equation A-4-27 assuming m = 0,  $ c_{c} = 0.2 $  Btu/lb- $ ^{\circ} $ F (840 J/kg-K),  $ h = T_{e} $ , and L = p/4. The following cross sections illustrate three different configurations for concrete masonry units or clay masonry unit encasement of steel columns, along with the applicable fire-protection design variables.

The fire-resistance rating, R, of hollow structural section (HSS) columns filled with unreinforced normal weight concrete, steel-fiber-reinforced normal weight concrete, or bar-reinforced normal weight concrete is permitted to be determined in accordance with Equation A-4-31 or A-4-31M:

 $$ R=\frac{0.58a\left(f_{c}^{\prime}+2.9\right)D^{2}\left(\frac{D}{C}\right)^{0.5}}{L_{c}-3.28} $$ 

 $$ R=\frac{a\Big(f_{c}^{\prime}+20\Big)D^{2}\Bigg(\frac{D}{C}\Bigg)^{0.5}}{60\Big(L_{c}-1\ 000\Big)} $$ 

where

C = compressive force due to unfactored dead load and live load, kips (kN)

D = outside diameter for circular columns, in. (mm)

= outside dimension for square columns, in. (mm)

= least outside dimension for rectangular columns, in. (mm)

 $ L_{c} $  = column effective length, ft (mm)

 $$ R = \mathrm{fire-resistance rating}, \mathrm{hr} $$ 

a = constant determined from Table A-4.3.4

 $ f_{c}^{\prime}=28 $ -day compressive strength of concrete, ksi (MPa)

The application of Equations A-4-31 and A-4-31M shall be limited by all of the following conditions:

(1) The required fire-resistance rating, R, shall be less than or equal to the limits specified in Tables A-4.3.5 or A-4.3.5M.

(2) The specified compressive strength of concrete,  $ f_{c}^{\prime} $ , the column effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , the dimension D, the concrete reinforcement ratio, and the thickness of the concrete cover shall be within the limits specified in Tables A-4.3.5 or A-4.3.5M.

(3) C shall not exceed the design strength of the concrete or the reinforced concrete core determined in accordance with this Specification.

(4) A minimum of two  $ \frac{1}{2} $ -in.- (13-mm-) diameter holes shall be placed opposite each other at the top and bottom of the column and at maximum 12 ft (3.7 m) on center spacing along the column height. Each set of vent holes should be rotated  $ 90^{\circ} $  relative to the adjacent set of holes to relieve steam pressure.

### 2 c. Composite or Noncomposite Steel I-Shaped Beams and Girders

The fire-resistance ratings of composite or noncomposite beams and girders shall be based upon the size of the element and the type of protection provided in accordance with this section.

These procedures establish a basis for determining resistance of structural steel beams and girders that differ in size from that specified in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant material and the weight, W, and heated perimeter, D, of the beam or girder.

The beams provided in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies shall be considered to be the minimum permissible size. Other beam or girder shapes are permitted to be substituted provided that the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio, W/D, of the substitute beam is equal to or greater than that of the minimum beam specified in the approved assembly.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_0.md -->

The provisions in this section apply to beams and girders protected with sprayed or intumescent or mastic fire-resistant materials.

Larger or smaller composite or noncomposite beam and girder shapes protected with sprayed fire-resistant materials are permitted to be substituted for beams specified in approved unrestrained or restrained fire-resistance-rated assemblies, provided that the thickness of the fire-resistant material is adjusted in accordance with Equation A-4-32 or A-4-32M.

The use of these equations shall be limited by all of the following conditions:

(a) The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio for the substitute beam or girder,  $ W_{1}/D_{1} $ , shall be not less than 0.37 (U.S. customary units) or 0.022 (SI units).

(b) The thickness of fire-protection materials calculated for the substitute beam or girder,  $ T_{1} $ , shall be not less than  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm).

(c) The unrestrained or restrained beam rating shall be not less than 1 hour.

(d) Where used to adjust the material thickness for a restrained beam, the use of this procedure is limited to sections classified as compact.

 $$ h_{2}=\frac{h_{1}\Big[\big(W_{1}/D_{1}\big)+0.60\Big]}{\Big[\big(W_{2}/D_{2}\big)+0.60\Big]} $$ 

 $$ h_{2}=\frac{h_{1}\Big[\big(W_{1}/D_{1}\big)+0.036\Big]}{\Big[\big(W_{2}/D_{2}\big)+0.036\Big]} $$ 

where

D = heated perimeter of the beam, in. (mm)

 $ W = \text{weight of the beam or girder, lb/ft (kg/m)} $ 

h = thickness of sprayed fire-resistant material, in. (mm)

Subscript 1 refers to the substitute beam or girder and the required thickness of fire-resistant material.

Subscript 2 refers to the beam and fire-resistant material thickness in the approved assembly.

User Note: This substitution equation based on W/D for beams protected with spray-applied fire-resistive materials was developed by UL with the given limitations. The minimum W/D ratio of 0.37 (0.022) prevents the use of this equation for determining the fire resistance of very small shapes that have not been tested. The  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm) minimum thickness of protection is a practical application limit based upon the most commonly used spray-applied fire protection materials.

The fire resistance of composite or noncomposite beams and girders protected with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings shall be determined on the basis of standard fire-resistance-rated assemblies, and associated computations and limits as provided in the applicable rated assemblies.

### 2 d. Concrete-Encased Steel Beams and Girders

The fire-resistance rating of concrete-encased steel beams and girders is permitted to be determined in accordance with Item 2-1.1 or 2-1.2 of Table A-4.3.1.

### 2 e. Trusses

The fire resistance of trusses with members individually protected by fire-resistant materials applied onto each of the individual truss elements is permitted to be determined for each member in accordance with Appendix 4, Section 4.3.1. The protection thickness of truss elements that can be simultaneously exposed to fire on all sides shall be determined for the same weight-to-heated perimeter ratio, W/D, as columns. The protection thickness of truss elements that directly support a floor or roof assembly is permitted to be determined for the same weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio, W/D, as for beams and girders.

### 2 f. Concrete Floor Slabs on Steel Deck

For composite concrete floor slabs on trapezoidal steel decking wherein the upper width of the deck rib is equal to or greater than its bottom rib width, the fire-resistance rating, based on the thermal insulation criterion for the unexposed surface temperature, is permitted to be calculated using the following equation:

 $$ \begin{aligned}R&=a_{0}+a_{1}h_{1}+a_{2}h_{2}+a_{3}l_{2}+a_{4}l_{3}+a_{5}m+a_{6}h_{1}^{2}\\&\quad+a_{7}h_{1}h_{2}+a_{8}h_{1}l_{2}+a_{9}h_{1}l_{3}+a_{10}h_{1}m+a_{11}h_{2}l_{2}\\&\quad+a_{12}h_{2}l_{3}+a_{13}h_{2}m+a_{14}l_{2}l_{3}+a_{15}l_{2}m+a_{16}l_{3}m\end{aligned} $$ 

where

 $$ R = \text{fire-resistance rating}, \text{min} $$ 

 $ h_{1}= $  concrete slab thickness above steel deck, in. (mm)

 $ h_{2}= $  depth of steel deck, in. (mm)

 $ l_{1} $  = largest upper width of deck rib, in. (mm)

 $ l_{2} $  = bottom width of deck rib, in. (mm)

 $ l_{3} $  = width of deck upper flange, in (mm)

m = moisture content of the concrete slab, %. Range of applicability is between 0% (0.0) and 10% (0.1).

User Note: The slab dimensions in Equation A-4-33 are illustrated in the following figure.

User Note: If moisture content values are not available,  $ m = 4\% $  can be used for normal weight concrete, and  $ m = 5\% $  can be used for lightweight concrete, consistent with Annex D of Eurocode 4. Dry conditions ( $ m = 0\% $ ) will yield the most conservative fire-resistance rating.

### 2 g. Composite Plate Shear Walls

For unprotected composite plate shear walls meeting the requirements of Chapter I and satisfying the following conditions, the fire-resistance rating shall be determined in accordance with Equation A-4-34 or A-4-34M.

(b) Axial load ratio,  $ P_{u}/P_{n} $ , is less than or equal to 0.2

(c) Wall thickness,  $ t_{sc} $ , is greater than or equal to 8 in. (200 mm)

 $$ R=\left[-18.5\left(\frac{P_{u}}{P_{n}}\right)^{\left(0.24-\frac{L/t_{sc}}{230}\right)}+15\right]\left(\frac{1.9t_{sc}}{8}-1\right) $$

where R is the fire rating in hours,  $ P_{u} $  is the required axial load in kips (N), and L,  $ P_{n} $ , and  $ t_{sc} $  are as defined in Chapter I.

### 3. Restrained Construction

For floor and roof assemblies and individual beams in buildings, a restrained condition exists when the surrounding or supporting structure is capable of resisting forces and accommodating deformations caused by thermal expansion throughout the range of anticipated elevated temperatures. Cast-in-place or prefabricated concrete floor or roof construction secured to steel framing members, and individual steel beams and girders that are welded or bolted to integral framing members, shall be considered restrained construction.

### 4. Unrestrained Construction

Steel beams, girders, and frames that do not support a concrete slab shall be considered unrestrained unless the members are bolted or welded to surrounding construction that has been specifically designed and detailed to resist the effects of elevated temperatures.

A steel member bearing on a wall in a single span or at the end span of multiple spans shall be considered unrestrained unless the wall has been designed and detailed to resist the effects of thermal expansion.

# APPENDIX 5 EVALUATION OF EXISTING STRUCTURES

This appendix applies to the evaluation of the strength and stiffness of existing structures by structural analysis, by load tests, or by a combination of structural analysis and load tests where specified by the engineer of record or in the contract documents. Load testing in accordance with this appendix applies to static vertical gravity load effects.

The appendix is organized as follows:

5.1. General Provisions

5.2. Material Properties

5.3. Evaluation by Structural Analysis

5.4. Evaluation by Load Tests

5.5. Evaluation Report

#### 5.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

These provisions shall be applicable where the evaluation of an existing steel structure is specified for (a) verification of a specific set of design loadings or (b) determination of the available strength of a load-resisting member or system. The evaluation shall be performed by structural analysis (Section 5.3), by load tests (Section 5.4), or by a combination of structural analysis and load tests, where specified in the contract documents by the engineer of record (EOR).

#### 5.2. MATERIAL PROPERTIES

For evaluations in accordance with this appendix, steel grades other than those listed in Section A3.1 are permitted.

### 1. Determination of Required Tests

The EOR shall determine the specific tests that are required from Sections 5.2.2 through 5.2.6 and specify the locations where they are required. The use of applicable project records is permitted to reduce or eliminate the need for testing.

### 2. Tensile Properties

Tensile properties of members shall be established for use in evaluation by structural analysis (Section 5.3) or load tests (Section 5.4). Such properties shall include the yield stress, tensile strength, and percentage of elongation. Certified material test reports or certified reports of tests made by the fabricator or a testing laboratory in accordance with ASTM A6/A6M or ASTM A568/A568M, as applicable, are permitted for this purpose. Otherwise, tensile tests shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM A370 from samples taken from components of the structure.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_5.md -->

### 3. Chemical Composition

Where welding is anticipated for repair or modification of existing structures, the chemical composition of the steel shall be determined for use in preparing a welding procedure specification. Results from certified material test reports or certified reports of tests made by the fabricator or a testing laboratory in accordance with ASTM procedures are permitted for this purpose. Otherwise, analyses shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM A751 from the samples used to determine tensile properties or from samples taken from the same locations.

### 4. Base Metal Notch Toughness

Where welded tension splices in heavy shapes and plates as defined in Section A3.1e are critical to the performance of the structure, the Charpy V-notch toughness shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section A3.1e. If the notch toughness so determined does not meet the provisions of Section A3.1e, the EOR shall determine if remedial actions are required.

### 5. Weld Metal

Where structural performance is dependent on existing welded connections, representative samples of weld metal shall be obtained. Chemical analysis and mechanical tests shall be made to characterize the weld metal. A determination shall be made of the magnitude and consequences of imperfections. If the requirements of Structural Welding Code—Steel, AWS D1.1/D1.1M, are not met, the EOR shall determine if remedial actions are required.

### 6. Bolts and Rivets

Representative samples of bolts shall be visually inspected to determine markings and classifications. Where it is not possible to classify bolts by visual inspection, representative samples shall be taken and tested to determine tensile strength in accordance with ASTM F606/F606M and the bolt classified accordingly. Alternatively, the assumption that the bolts are ASTM A307 is permitted. Rivets shall be assumed to be ASTM A502, Grade 1, unless a higher grade is established through documentation or testing.

#### 5.3. EVALUATION BY STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### 1. Dimensional Data

All dimensions used in the evaluation, such as spans, column heights, member spacings, bracing locations, cross-section dimensions, thicknesses, and connection details, shall be determined from a field survey. Alternatively, it is permitted to determine such dimensions from applicable project design or fabrication documents with field verification of critical values.

### 2. Strength Evaluation

Forces (load effects) in members and connections shall be determined by structural analysis applicable to the type of structure evaluated. The load effects shall be determined for the loads and factored load combinations stipulated in Section B2.

The design tensile or shear strength,  $ \phi R_{n} $ , and the allowable tensile or shear strength,  $ R_{n}/\Omega $ , of a driven rivet shall be determined according to Section J3.7, and driven rivets under combined tension and shear shall satisfy the requirements of Section J3.8.

where

 $$ A_{b}=\mathrm{nominal~body~area~of~undriven~rivet,~in.}^{2}(\mathrm{mm}^{2}) $$ 

$F_{nt} = \text{nominal tensile strength of the driven rivet from Table A-5.3.1, ksi (MPa)}$

 $ F_{nv}= $  nominal shear strength of the driven rivet from Table A-5.3.1, ksi (MPa)

### 3. Serviceability Evaluation

Where required, the deformations at service loads shall be calculated and reported.

#### 5.4. EVALUATION BY LOAD TESTS

### 1. General Requirements

This section applies only to static vertical gravity loads applied to existing roofs or floors.

Where load tests are used, the EOR shall first analyze the structure, prepare a testing plan, and develop a written procedure for the test. The plan shall consider collapse and/or excessive levels of permanent deformation, as defined by the EOR, and shall include procedures to preclude either occurrence during testing.

### 2. Determination of Load Rating by Testing

To determine the load rating of an existing floor or roof structure by testing, a test load shall be applied incrementally in accordance with the EOR's plan. The structure shall be visually inspected for signs of distress or imminent failure at each load level. Measures shall be taken to prevent collapse if these or any other unusual conditions are encountered.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_7.md -->

The tested strength of the structure shall be taken as the maximum applied test load plus the in-situ dead load. The live load rating of a floor structure shall be determined by setting the tested strength equal to  $ 1.2D + 1.6L $ , where D is the nominal dead load and L is the nominal live load rating for the structure. For roof structures,  $ L_{r} $ , S, or R shall be substituted for L.

where

 $ L_{r} $  = nominal roof live load

R = nominal load due to rainwater or snow, exclusive of the ponding contribution

 $$ S = nominal snow load $$ 

More severe load combinations shall be used where required by the applicable building codes.

Periodic unloading is permitted once the service load level is attained, and after the onset of inelastic structural behavior is identified, to document the amount of permanent set and the magnitude of the inelastic deformations. Deformations of the structure, such as member deflections, shall be monitored at critical locations during the test, referenced to the initial position before loading. It shall be demonstrated, while maintaining maximum test load for one hour, that the deformation of the structure does not increase by more than 10% above that at the beginning of the holding period. It is permissible to repeat the test loading sequence if necessary to demonstrate compliance.

Deformations of the structure shall also be recorded 24 hours after the test loading is removed to determine the amount of permanent set.

Where it is not feasible to load test the entire structure, a segment or zone of not less than one complete bay representative of the most critical condition shall be selected.

### 3. Serviceability Evaluation

Where load tests are prescribed, the structure shall be loaded incrementally to the service load level. The service test load shall be held for a period of one hour and deformations shall be recorded at the beginning and at the end of the one-hour holding period.

#### 5.5. EVALUATION REPORT

After the evaluation of an existing structure has been completed, the EOR shall prepare a report documenting the evaluation. The report shall indicate whether the evaluation was performed by structural analysis, by load testing, or by a combination of structural analysis and load testing. Furthermore, where testing is performed, the report shall include the loads and load combination used and the load-deformation and time-deformation relationships observed. All relevant information obtained from design documents, material test reports, and auxiliary material testing shall also be reported. The report shall indicate whether the structure, including all members and connections, can withstand the load effects.

# APPENDIX 6 MEMBER STABILITY BRACING

This appendix addresses the minimum strength and stiffness necessary for bracing to develop the required strength of a column, beam, or beam-column. The appendix is organized as follows:

6.1. General Provisions

6.2. Column Bracing

6.3. Beam Bracing

6.4. Beam-Column Bracing

User Note: Stability requirements for lateral force-resisting systems are provided in Chapter C. The provisions in this appendix apply to bracing that is not generally included in the analysis model of the overall structure, but is provided to stabilize individual columns, beams, and beam-columns. Guidance for applying these provisions to stabilize trusses is provided in the Commentary.

#### 6.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Bracing systems shall have the strength and stiffness specified in this appendix, as applicable. Where such a system braces more than one member, the strength and stiffness of the bracing shall be based on the sum of the required strengths of all members being braced, and shall consider the flexibility of all components in the system. The evaluation of the stiffness furnished by the bracing shall include the effects of connections and anchoring details.

User Note: More detailed analyses for bracing strength and stiffness are presented in the Commentary.

A panel brace (formerly referred to as a relative brace) limits the angular deviation of a segment of the braced member between braced points (that is, the lateral displacement of one end of the segment relative to the other). A point brace (formerly referred to as a nodal brace) limits the movement at the braced point without direct interaction with adjacent braced points. A continuous bracing system consists of bracing that is attached along the entire member length.

The available strength and stiffness of the bracing members and connections shall equal or exceed the required strength and stiffness, respectively, unless analysis indicates that smaller values are justified.

Columns, beams, and beam-columns with end and intermediate braced points designed to meet the requirements in Sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, as applicable, are permitted to be designed based on lengths  $ L_{c} $  and  $ L_{b} $ , as defined in Chapters E and F, taken equal to the distance between the braced points.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_9.md -->

In lieu of the requirements of Sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4,

(a) The required brace strength and stiffness can be obtained using a second-order analysis that satisfies the provisions of Chapter C or Appendix 1, as appropriate, and includes brace points displaced from their nominal locations in a pattern that provides for the greatest demand on the bracing.

(b) The required bracing stiffness can be obtained as  $ 2/\phi $  (LRFD) or  $ 2\Omega $  (ASD) times the ideal bracing stiffness determined from a buckling analysis. The required brace strength can be determined using the provisions of Sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, as applicable.

(c) For either of the above analysis methods, members with end or intermediate braced points meeting these requirements may be designed based on effective lengths,  $ L_{c} $  and  $ L_{b} $ , taken less than the distance between braced points.

User Note: The stability bracing requirements in Sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 are based on buckling analysis models involving idealizations of common bracing conditions. Computational analysis methods may be used for greater generality, accuracy, and efficiency for more complex bracing conditions. The Commentary to Section 6.1 provides guidance on these considerations.

#### 6.2. COLUMN BRACING

It is permitted to laterally brace an individual column at end and intermediate points along its length using either panel or point bracing.

User Note: This section provides requirements only for lateral bracing. Column lateral bracing is assumed to be located at the shear center of the column. When lateral bracing does not limit twist, the column is susceptible to torsional buckling as addressed in Section E4. When the lateral bracing is offset from the shear center, the column is susceptible to constrained-axis torsional buckling, which is also addressed in Section E4 and its accompanying Commentary.

### 1. Panel Bracing

The panel bracing system shall have the strength and stiffness specified in this section. The connection of the bracing system to the column shall have the strength specified in Section 6.2.2 for a point brace at that location.

User Note: If the stiffness of the connection to the panel bracing system is comparable to the stiffness of the panel bracing system itself, the panel bracing system and its connection to the column function as a panel and point bracing system arranged in series. Such cases may be evaluated using the alternative analysis methods listed in Section 6.1.

In the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the column, the required shear strength of the bracing system is

 $$ V_{br}=0.005P_{r} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_10.md -->

and the required shear stiffness of the bracing system is

 $$ \beta_{br}=\frac{1}{\phi}\Bigg(\frac{2P_{r}}{L_{br}}\Bigg)\ \mathrm{(LRFD)} $$ 

 $$ \beta_{br}=\Omega\Bigg(\frac{2P_{r}}{L_{br}}\Bigg)\ (ASD) $$ 

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=2.00(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ L_{br} $  = unbraced length within the panel under consideration, in. (mm)

 $ P_{r} $  = required axial strength of the column within the panel under consideration using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kips (N)

### 2. Point Bracing

In the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the column, the required strength of end and intermediate point braces is

 $$ P_{br}=0.01P_{r} $$ 

and the required stiffness of the brace is

 $$ \beta_{br}=\frac{1}{\phi}\Bigg(\frac{8P_{r}}{L_{br}}\Bigg)\ (LRFD) $$ 

 $$ \beta_{br}=\Omega\left(\frac{8P_{r}}{L_{br}}\right)(ASD) $$ 

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=2.00(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ L_{br} $  = unbraced length adjacent to the point brace, in. (mm)

 $ P_{r} $  = largest of the required axial strengths of the column within the unbraced lengths adjacent to the point brace using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kips (N)

When the unbraced lengths adjacent to a point brace have different  $ P_{r}/L_{br} $  values, the larger value shall be used to determine the required brace stiffness.

For intermediate point bracing of an individual column,  $ L_{br} $  in Equations A-6-4a or A-6-4b need not be taken as less than the maximum effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , permitted for the column based upon the required axial strength,  $ P_{r} $ .

#### 6.3. BEAM BRACING

Beams shall be restrained against rotation about their longitudinal axis at points of support. When a braced point is assumed in the design between points of support, lateral bracing, torsional bracing, or a combination of the two shall be provided to limit the relative displacement of the top and bottom flanges (i.e., to resist twist). In members subjected to double curvature bending, the inflection point shall not be considered a braced point unless bracing is provided at that location.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_11.md -->

The requirements of this section shall apply to bracing of doubly and singly symmetric I-shaped members subjected to flexure within a plane of symmetry and zero net axial force.

### 1. Lateral Bracing

Lateral bracing shall be attached at or near the beam compression flange, except as follows:

(a) At the free end of a cantilevered beam, lateral bracing shall be attached at or near the top (tension) flange.

(b) For braced beams subjected to double curvature bending, bracing shall be attached at or near both flanges at the braced point nearest the inflection point.

It is permitted to use either panel or point bracing to provide lateral bracing for beams.

### 1 a. Panel Bracing

The panel bracing system shall have the strength and stiffness specified in this section. The connection of the bracing system to the member shall have the strength specified in Section 6.3.1b for a point brace at that location.

User Note: The stiffness contribution of the connection to the panel bracing system should be assessed as provided in the User Note to Section 6.2.1.

The required shear strength of the bracing system is

 $$ V_{br}=0.01\Bigg(\frac{M_{r} C_{d}}{h_{o}}\Bigg) $$ 

and, the required shear stiffness of the bracing system is

 $$ \beta_{br}=\frac{1}{\phi}\Bigg(\frac{4M_{r}C_{d}}{L_{br}h_{o}}\Bigg)(LRFD) $$ 

 $$ \beta_{br}=\Omega\left(\frac{4M_{r}C_{d}}{L_{br}h_{o}}\right)(ASD) $$ 

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=2.00(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ C_{d}=1.0 $ , except in the following case

= 2.0 for the brace closest to the inflection point in a beam subjected to double curvature bending

 $ L_{br}= $  unbraced length within the panel under consideration, in. (mm)

 $ M_{r}= $  required flexural strength of the beam within the panel under consideration using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ h_{o} $  = distance between flange centroids, in. (mm)

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_12.md -->

### 1 b. Point Bracing

In the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the beam, the required strength of end and intermediate point braces is

 $$ P_{br}=0.02\Bigg(\frac{M_{r}C_{d}}{h_{o}}\Bigg) $$ 

and the required stiffness of the brace is

 $$ \beta_{br}=\frac{1}{\phi}\Bigg(\frac{10M_{r}C_{d}}{L_{br}h_{o}}\Bigg)(LRFD) $$ 

 $$ \beta_{br}=\Omega\left(\frac{10M_{r}C_{d}}{L_{br}h_{o}}\right)(ASD) $$ 

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD)\qquad\Omega=2.00(ASD) $$ 

where

 $ L_{br} $  = unbraced length adjacent to the point brace, in. (mm)

 $ M_{r}= $  largest of the required flexural strengths of the beam within the unbraced lengths adjacent to the point brace using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kip-in. (N-mm)

When the unbraced lengths adjacent to a point brace have different  $ M_{r}/L_{br} $  values, the larger value shall be used to determine the required brace stiffness.

For intermediate point bracing of an individual beam,  $ L_{br} $  in Equations A-6-8a or A-6-8b need not be taken as less than the maximum effective length,  $ L_{b} $ , permitted for the beam based upon the required flexural strength,  $ M_{r} $ .

### 2. Torsional Bracing

It is permitted to attach torsional bracing at any cross-section location, and it need not be attached near the compression flange.

User Note: Torsional bracing can be provided as point bracing, such as cross-frames, moment-connected beams, or vertical diaphragm elements, or as continuous bracing, such as slabs or decks.

### 2 a. Point Bracing

About the longitudinal axis of the beam, the required flexural strength of the brace is

 $$ M_{br}=\frac{3.6L}{nEI_{yeff}}\Bigg(\frac{M_{r}}{C_{b}}\Bigg)^{2}\Bigg(\frac{L_{br}}{500h_{o}}\Bigg)\geq0.02M_{r} $$ 

and the required flexural stiffness of the brace is

 $$ \beta_{br}=\frac{\beta_{T}}{\left(1-\frac{\beta_{T}}{\beta_{sec}}\right)} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_13.md -->

where

 $$ \beta_{T}\ =\frac{1}{\phi}\frac{3.6L}{nEI_{yeff}}\left(\frac{M_{r}}{C_{b}}\right)^{2}\ (LRFD) $$ 

 $$ \beta_{T}=\Omega\frac{3.6L}{nEI_{yeff}}\left(\frac{M_{r}}{C_{b}}\right)^{2}\ (ASD) $$ 

 $$ \beta_{sec}=\frac{3.3E}{h_{o}}\Bigg(\frac{1.5h_{o}t_{w}^{3}}{12}+\frac{t_{st}b_{s}^{3}}{12}\Bigg) $$ 

and

 $$ \phi=0.75(LRFD);\Omega=3.00(ASD) $$ 

User Note: The relationship between  $ \phi $  and  $ \Omega $  used in Equations A-6-11a and A-6-11b is  $ \Omega=1.5^{2}/\phi=3.00 $ , because the moment term is squared.

 $ \beta_{sec} $  can be taken as equal to infinity, and  $ \beta_{br} = \beta_{T} $ , when a cross-frame is attached near both flanges or a vertical diaphragm element is used that is approximately the same depth as the beam being braced.

E = modulus of elasticity of steel
= 29,000 ksi (200 000 MPa)
 $ I_{y_{eff}} $  = effective out-of-plane moment of inertia, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )
 $ I_{yc} $  = moment of inertia of the compression flange about the y-axis, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )
 $ I_{yt} $  = moment of inertia of the tension flange about the y-axis, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )
L = length of span, in. (mm)
 $ L_{br} $  = unbraced length adjacent to the point brace, in. (mm)
 $ M_{r} $  = largest of the required flexural strengths of the beam within the unbraced lengths adjacent to the point brace, using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kip-in. (N-mm)
 $ \frac{M_{r}}{C_{b}} $  = maximum value of the required flexural strength of the beam divided by the moment gradient factor, within the unbraced lengths adjacent to the point brace, using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kip-in. (N-mm)
 $ b_{s} $  = stiffener width for one-sided stiffeners, in. (mm)
= twice the individual stiffener width for pairs of stiffeners, in. (mm)
c = distance from the neutral axis to the extreme compressive fibers, in. (mm)
n = number of braced points within the span
t = distance from the neutral axis to the extreme tensile fibers, in. (mm)
 $ t_{st} $  = thickness of web stiffener, in. (mm)
 $ t_{w} $  = thickness of beam web, in. (mm)
 $ \beta_{T} $  = overall brace system required stiffness, kip-in./rad (N-mm/rad)
 $ \beta_{sec} $  = web distortional stiffness, including the effect of web transverse stiffeners, if any, kip-in./rad (N-mm/rad)

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_14.md -->

User Note: If  $ \beta_{sec} < \beta_{T} $ , Equation A-6-10 is negative, which indicates that torsional beam bracing will not be effective due to inadequate web distortional stiffness.

User Note: For doubly symmetric members, $c = t$ and $I_{y eff} = \text{out-of-plane moment of inertia}, I_{y}, \text{in.}^{4} (\text{mm}^{4})$.

When required, a web stiffener shall extend the full depth of the braced member and shall be attached to the flange if the torsional brace is also attached to the flange. Alternatively, it is permissible to stop the stiffener short by a distance equal to  $ 4t_{w} $  from any beam flange that is not directly attached to the torsional brace.

When the expression,  $ \left(M_{r}/C_{b}\right)^{2}L_{br} $ , within the unbraced lengths adjacent to a point brace, has different values, the larger value shall be used to determine the required brace strength and stiffness.

In Equation A-6-9,  $ L_{br} $  need not be taken as less than the maximum unbraced length permitted for the beam based upon the required flexural strength,  $ M_{r} $ .

### 2 b. Continuous Bracing

For continuous torsional bracing:

(a) The brace strength requirement per unit length along the beam shall be taken as Equation A-6-9 divided by the maximum unbraced length permitted for the beam based upon the required flexural strength,  $ M_{r} $ . The required flexural strength,  $ M_{r} $ , shall be taken as the maximum value throughout the beam span.

(b) The brace stiffness requirement per unit length shall be given by Equations A-6-10 and A-6-11 with L/n = 1.0.

(c) The web distortional stiffness shall be taken as

 $$ \beta_{sec}=\frac{3.3Et_{w}^{3}}{12h_{o}} $$ 

#### 6.4. BEAM-COLUMN BRACING

For bracing of beam-columns, the required strength and stiffness for the axial force shall be determined as specified in Section 6.2, and the required strength and stiffness for flexure shall be determined as specified in Section 6.3. The values so determined shall be combined as follows:

(a) When panel bracing is used, the required strength shall be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-1 and A-6-5, and the required stiffness shall be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-2 and A-6-6.

(b) When point bracing is used, the required strength shall be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-3 and A-6-7, and the required stiffness shall be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-4 and

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_15.md -->

A-6-8. In Equations A-6-4 and A-6-8,  $ L_{br} $  for beam-columns shall be taken as the actual unbraced length; the provision in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.3.1b, that  $ L_{br} $  need not be taken as less than the maximum permitted effective length based upon  $ P_{r} $  and  $ M_{r} $ , shall not be applied.

(c) When torsional bracing is provided for flexure in combination with panel or point bracing for the axial force, the required strength and stiffness shall be combined or distributed in a manner that is consistent with the resistance provided by the element(s) of the actual bracing details.

(d) When the combined stress effect from axial force and flexure results in compression to both flanges, either lateral bracing shall be added to both flanges or both flanges shall be laterally restrained by a combination of lateral and torsional bracing.

User Note: For case (d), additional guidelines are provided in the Commentary.

# APPENDIX 7

# ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF DESIGN FOR STABILITY

This appendix presents alternatives to the direct analysis method of design for stability defined in Chapter C. The two alternative methods covered are the effective length method and the first-order analysis method.

The appendix is organized as follows:

7.1. General Stability Requirements

7.2. Effective Length Method

7.3. First-Order Analysis Method

#### 7.1. GENERAL STABILITY REQUIREMENTS

The general requirements of Section C1 shall apply. As an alternative to the direct analysis method (defined in Sections C1 and C2), it is permissible to design structures for stability in accordance with either the effective length method, specified in Section 7.2, or the first-order analysis method, specified in Section 7.3, subject to the limitations indicated in those sections.

#### 7.2. EFFECTIVE LENGTH METHOD

### 1. Limitations

When using the effective length method, the following conditions shall be met:

(a) The structure supports gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical columns, walls, or frames.

(b) The ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first-order drift (both determined for load and resistance factor design (LRFD) load combinations or 1.6 times allowable strength design (ASD) load combinations, with stiffness not adjusted as specified in Section C2.3) in all stories is equal to or less than 1.5.

User Note: The ratio of second-order drift to first-order drift in a story may be taken as the  $ B_{2} $  multiplier, calculated as specified in Appendix 8.

### 2. Required Strengths

The required strengths of components shall be determined from an elastic analysis conforming to the requirements of Section C2.1, except that the stiffness reduction indicated in Section C2.1(a) shall not be applied; the nominal stiffnesses of all structural steel components shall be used. Notional loads shall be applied in the analysis in accordance with Section C2.2b.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_17.md -->

User Note: Because the condition specified in Section C2.2b(d) will be satisfied in all cases where the effective length method is applicable, the notional load need only be applied in gravity-only load cases.

### 3. Available Strengths

The available strengths of members and connections shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapters D through K, as applicable.

For flexural buckling, the effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , of members subjected to compression shall be taken as KL, where K is as specified in (a) or (b), in the following, as applicable, and L is the laterally unbraced length of the member.

(a) In braced-frame systems, shear-wall systems, and other structural systems where lateral stability and resistance to lateral loads does not rely on the flexural stiffness of columns, the effective length factor, K, of members subjected to compression shall be taken as unity unless a smaller value is justified by rational analysis.

(b) In moment-frame systems and other structural systems in which the flexural stiffness of columns are considered to contribute to lateral stability and resistance to lateral loads, the effective length factor, K, or elastic critical buckling stress,  $ F_{e} $ , of those columns whose flexural stiffnesses are considered to contribute to lateral stability and resistance to lateral loads shall be determined from a sideway buckling analysis of the structure; K shall be taken as 1.0 for columns whose flexural stiffnesses are not considered to contribute to lateral stability and resistance to lateral loads.

Exception: It is permitted to use K = 1.0 in the design of all columns if the ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first-order drift (both determined for LRFD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations) in all stories is equal to or less than 1.1.

User Note: Methods of calculating the effective length factor, K, are discussed in the Commentary.

Bracing intended to define the unbraced lengths of members shall have sufficient stiffness and strength to limit member movement at the braced points.

User Note: Methods of satisfying the bracing requirement are provided in Appendix 6. The requirements of Appendix 6 are not applicable to bracing that is included in the design of the lateral force-resisting system of the overall structure.

#### 7.3. FIRST-ORDER ANALYSIS METHOD

### 1. Limitations

When using the first-order analysis method, the following conditions shall be met:

(a) The structure supports gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical columns, walls, or frames.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_18.md -->

 $$ E=m o d u l u s o f e l a s t i c i t y o f s t e e l,k s i(M P a) $$ 

(b) The required axial compressive strengths in nominally horizontal members in moment frames subjected to bending satisfy the following limitation:

 $$ \alpha P_{r}\leq0.08P_{e} $$ 

where

 $$ \alpha=1.0(LRFD);\alpha=1.6(ASD) $$ 

 $$ P_{e}=\pi^{2}EI/L^{2},\mathrm{k i p s~(N)} $$ 

 $$ =29,000\ km\text{s i}(200\ 000\ MPa) $$ 

 $$ I_{ 冚 }=moment of inertia in the plane of bending,in.^{4}(mm^{4}) $$ 

 $$ L_{ 氷 }=height of story,in.(mm) $$ 

 $ P_{r} $  = required axial compressive strength using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kips (N)

(c) The ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first-order drift (both determined for LRFD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations, with stiffness not adjusted as specified in Section C2.3) in all stories is equal to or less than 1.5.

User Note: The ratio of second-order drift to first-order drift in a story may be taken as the  $ B_{2} $  multiplier, calculated as specified in Appendix 8.

(d) The required axial compressive strengths of all members whose flexural stiffnesses are considered to contribute to the lateral stability of the structure satisfy the following limitation:

 $$ \alpha P_{r}\leq0.5P_{ns} $$ 

where

$P_{ns} = \text{cross-section compressive strength; for nonslender-element sections}, P_{ns} = F_{y}A_{g}$, and for slender-element sections, $P_{ns} = F_{y}A_{e}$, where $A_{e}$ is as defined in Section E7 with $F_{n} = F_{y}$, kips (N)

### 2. Required Strengths

The required strengths of components shall be determined from a first-order analysis, with additional requirements (a) and (b) given in the following. The analysis shall consider flexural, shear, and axial member deformations, and all other deformations that contribute to displacements of the structure.

(a) All load combinations shall include an additional lateral load,  $ N_{i} $ , applied in combination with other loads at each level of the structure:

 $$ N_{i}=2.1\alpha(\Delta/L)Y_{i}\geq0.0042Y_{i} $$ 

where

 $$ \alpha=1.0(LRFD);\alpha=1.6(ASD) $$ 

 $ Y_{i} = gravity load applied at level i from the LRFD load combination or ASD load combination, as applicable, kips (N) $ 

 $ \Delta/L= $  maximum ratio of  $ \Delta $  to L for all stories in the structure

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_19.md -->

 $ \Delta $  = first-order interstory drift due to the LRFD or ASD load combination, as applicable, in. (mm). Where  $ \Delta $  varies over the plan area of the structure,  $ \Delta $  shall be the average drift weighted in proportion to vertical load or, alternatively, the maximum drift.

 $$ L = \text{height of story, in. (mm)} $$ 

The additional lateral load at any level,  $ N_{i} $ , shall be distributed over that level in the same manner as the gravity load at the level. The additional lateral loads shall be applied in the direction that provides the greatest destabilizing effect.

User Note: For most building structures, the requirement regarding the direction of  $ N_{i} $  may be satisfied as follows: (a) For load combinations that do not include lateral loading, consider two alternative orthogonal directions for the additional lateral load in a positive and a negative sense in each of the two directions, same direction at all levels; (b) for load combinations that include lateral loading, apply all the additional lateral loads in the direction of the resultant of all lateral loads in the combination.

(b) The nonsway amplification of beam-column moments shall be included by applying the  $ B_{1} $  amplifier of Appendix 8 to the total member moments.

User Note: Since there is no second-order analysis involved in the first-order analysis method for design by ASD, it is not necessary to amplify ASD load combinations by 1.6 before performing the analysis, as required in the direct analysis method and the effective length method.

### 3. Available Strengths

The available strengths of members and connections shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapters D through K, as applicable.

The effective length for flexural buckling of all members shall be taken as the unbraced length unless a smaller value is justified by rational analysis.

Bracing intended to define the unbraced lengths of members shall have sufficient stiffness and strength to limit member movement at the braced points.

User Note: Methods of satisfying this requirement are provided in Appendix 6. The requirements of Appendix 6 are not applicable to bracing that is included in the analysis of the overall structure as part of the overall force-resisting system.

# APPENDIX 8 APPROXIMATE ANALYSIS

This appendix provides approximate analysis procedures for determining the required strength of structural members and connections.

The appendix is organized as follows:

8.1. Approximate Second-Order Elastic Analysis

8.2. Approximate Inelastic Moment Redistribution

#### 8.1. APPROXIMATE SECOND-ORDER ELASTIC ANALYSIS

Second-order effects in structures may be approximated by amplifying the required strengths determined by two first-order elastic analyses. The use of this procedure is limited to structures that support gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical columns, walls, or frames, except that it is permissible to use the procedure specified for determining  $ P-\delta $  effects for any individual compression member. This method is not permitted for design by advanced analysis using the provisions of Appendix 1.

User Note: The two first-order elastic analyses are (1) restrained against lateral translation (nt—no translation), and (2) lateral translation (lt), using the subscript notation in Equations A-8-1 and A-8-2.

### 1. Calculation Procedure

The required second-order flexural strength,  $ M_{r} $ , and axial strength,  $ P_{r} $ , of all members shall be determined as

 $$ M_{r}=B_{1}M_{nt}+B_{2}M_{lt} $$ 

 $$ P_{r}=P_{nt}+B_{2}P_{lt} $$ 

where

 $ B_{1} $  = multiplier to account for  $ P-\delta $  effects, determined for each member subjected to compression and flexure, and each direction of bending of the member in accordance with Appendix 8, Section 8.1.2.  $ B_{1} $  shall be taken as 1.0 for members not subjected to compression.

 $ B_{2} $  = multiplier to account for  $ P-\Delta $  effects, determined for each story of the structure and each direction of lateral translation of the story in accordance with Appendix 8, Section 8.1.3.

 $ M_{lt} $  = first-order moment using LRFD or ASD load combinations, due to lateral translation of the structure only, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{nt}= $  first-order moment using LRFD or ASD load combinations, with the structure restrained against lateral translation, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{r} $  = required second-order flexural strength using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kip-in. (N-mm)

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_21.md -->

 $ P_{lt} $  = first-order axial force using LRFD or ASD load combinations, due to lateral translation of the structure only, kips (N)

 $ P_{nt} $  = first-order axial force using LRFD or ASD load combinations, with the structure restrained against lateral translation, kips (N)

 $ P_{r} $  = required second-order axial strength using LRFD or ASD load combinations, kips (N)

User Note: Equations A-8-1 and A-8-2 are applicable to all members in all structures. Note, however, that  $ B_{1} $  values other than unity apply only to moments in beam-columns;  $ B_{2} $  applies to moments and axial forces in components of the lateral force-resisting system (including columns, beams, bracing members, and shear walls). See the Commentary for more on the application of Equations A-8-1 and A-8-2.

### 2. Multiplier  $ B_{1} $  for  $ P-\delta $  Effects

The  $ B_{1} $  multiplier for each member subjected to compression and each direction of bending of the member is calculated as follows:

 $$ B_{1}=\frac{C_{m}}{1-\alpha P_{r}/P_{e1}}\geq1 $$ 

where

 $$ \alpha_{ 冚 }=1.0(LRFD);\alpha_{ 冚 }=1.6(ASD) $$ 

 $ C_{m} $  = equivalent uniform moment factor, assuming no relative translation of the member ends, determined as follows:

(a) For beam-columns not subjected to transverse loading between supports in the plane of bending

 $$ C_{m}=0.6-0.4\left(M_{1}/M_{2}\right) $$ 

where  $ M_{1} $  and  $ M_{2} $ , calculated from a first-order analysis, are the smaller and larger moments, respectively, at the ends of that portion of the member unbraced in the plane of bending under consideration.  $ M_{1}/M_{2} $  is positive when the member is bent in reverse curvature and negative when bent in single curvature.

(b) For beam-columns subjected to transverse loading between supports, the value of  $ C_{m} $  shall be determined either by analysis or conservatively taken as 1.0 for all cases.

 $ P_{e1}= $  elastic critical buckling strength of the member in the plane of bending, calculated based on the assumption of no lateral translation at the member ends, kips (N)

 $$ =\frac{\pi^{2}EI^{*}}{\left(L_{c1}\right)^{2}} $$ 

 $ EI^{*}= $ flexural rigidity required to be used in the analysis, kip-in. $ ^{2} $  (N-mm $ ^{2} $ )  $ (\mathrm{=0.8}\tau_{b}\mathrm{EI}) $  when used in the direct analysis method, where  $ \tau_{b} $  is as defined in Chapter C; =EI for the effective length and first-order analysis methods

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_12/doc_22.md -->

 $$ E = \text{modulus of elasticity of steel} $$ 

= 29,000 ksi (200 000 MPa)

I = moment of inertia in the plane of bending, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

 $ L_{c1}= $  effective length in the plane of bending, calculated based on the assumption of no lateral translation at the member ends, set equal to the laterally unbraced length of the member unless analysis justifies a smaller value, in. (mm)

It is permitted to use the first-order estimate of  $ P_{r} $  (i.e.,  $ P_{r} = P_{nt} + P_{lt} $ ) in Equation A-8-3.

### 3. Multiplier  $ B_{2} $  for  $ P-\Delta $  Effects

The  $ B_{2} $  multiplier for each story and each direction of lateral translation is calculated as follows:

 $$ B_{2}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{\alpha P_{story}}{P_{e\ story}}}\geq1 $$ 

where

 $$ \alpha_{ 冮 }=1.0(LRFD);\alpha=1.6(ASD) $$ 

 $ P_{story} $  = total vertical load supported by the story using LRFD or ASD load combinations, as applicable, including loads in columns that are not part of the lateral force-resisting system, kips (N)

 $ P_{e\ story}= $  elastic critical buckling strength for the story in the direction of translation being considered, kips (N), determined by sideway buckling analysis or as given in Equation A-8-7.

 $$ =R_{M}\frac{HL}{\Delta_{H}} $$ 

H = total story shear, in the direction of translation being considered, produced by the lateral forces used to compute  $ \Delta_{H} $ , kips (N)

L = height of story, in. (mm)

 $$ \begin{array}{r l r}{R_{M}}&{{}}&{=1-0.15\big(P_{m f}/P_{s t o r y}\big)}\end{array} $$ 

 $ P_{mf} $  = total vertical load in columns in the story that are part of moment frames, if any, in the direction of translation being considered (= 0 for braced-frame systems), kips (N)

 $ \Delta_{H} $  = first-order interstory drift, in the direction of translation being considered, due to lateral forces, in. (mm), computed using the stiffness required to be used in the analysis. (When the direct analysis method is used, stiffness is reduced according to Section C2.3.) Where  $ \Delta_{H} $  varies over the plan area of the structure, it shall be the average drift weighted in proportion to vertical load or, alternatively, the maximum drift.

User Note: The story gravity load  $ (P_{story} $  and  $ P_{mf}) $  includes loading from levels above and on nonframe columns and walls, and the weight of wall panels laterally supported by the lateral force-resisting system; it need not include the vertical component of the seismic force.

User Note:  $ R_{M} $  can be taken as 0.85 as a lower-bound value for stories that include moment frames, and  $ R_{M}=1 $  if there are no moment frames in the story. H and  $ \Delta_{H} $  in Equation A-8-7 may be based on any lateral loading that provides a representative value of story lateral stiffness,  $ H/\Delta_{H} $ .

#### 8.2. APPROXIMATE INELASTIC MOMENT REDISTRIBUTION

The required flexural strength of indeterminate beams composed of compact sections, as defined in Section B4.1, carrying gravity loads only, and satisfying the unbraced length requirements provided in this section, is permitted to be taken as nine-tenths of the negative moments at the points of support, produced by the gravity loading and determined by an elastic analysis satisfying the requirements of Chapter C, provided that the maximum positive moment is increased by one-tenth of the average negative moment determined by an elastic analysis. This moment redistribution is not permitted for moments in members with  $ F_{y} $  exceeding 65 ksi (450 MPa), for moments produced by loading on cantilevers, for design using partially restrained (PR) moment connections, or for design by inelastic analysis using the provisions of Appendix 1.3. This moment redistribution is permitted for design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD) and for design according to Section B3.2 (ASD). The required axial strength shall not exceed  $ 0.15\phi_{c}F_{y}A_{g} $  for LRFD or  $ 0.15F_{y}A_{g}/\Omega_{c} $  for ASD, where  $ \phi_{c} $  and  $ \Omega_{c} $  are determined from Section E1,  $ A_{g}= $  gross area of member, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ ), and  $ F_{y}= $  specified minimum yield stress, ksi (MPa).

The laterally unbraced length,  $ L_{b} $ , of the compression flange adjacent to the redistributed end moment locations shall not exceed  $ L_{m} $  determined as follows.

(a) For doubly symmetric and singly symmetric I-shaped beams with  $ I_{yc} $  of the compression flange equal to or larger than  $ I_{yt} $  of the tension flange loaded in the plane of the web

 $$ L_{m}=\left[0.12+0.076\bigg(\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}\bigg)\right]\left(\frac{E}{F_{y}}\right)r_{y} $$ 

(b) For solid rectangular bars and for rectangular HSS and symmetric box beams bent about their major axis

 $$ L_{m}=\left[0.17+0.10\left(\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}\right)\right]\left(\frac{E}{F_{y}}\right)r_{y}\geq0.10\left(\frac{E}{F_{y}}\right)r_{y} $$ 

where

 $$ F_{y}=specified minimum yield stress of the compression flange,ksi(MPa) $$ 

 $ M_{1}= $  smaller moment at end of unbraced length, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{2}= $  larger moment at end of unbraced length, kip-in. (N-mm)

r y = radius of gyration about y-axis, in. (mm)

 $ \left(M_{1}/M_{2}\right) $  is positive when moments cause reverse curvature and negative for single curvature

There is no limit on  $ L_{b} $  for members with round or square cross sections or for any beam bent about its minor axis.
