Selden et al. (2015) indicate that long beams designed at low levels of partial composite action may not reach their nominal strength due to lack of connector deformation capacity.

The consideration of ductility demand at the interface of composite beams can come in the form of a number of different approaches of varying degrees of complexity. These approaches generally fall into two groups. First, the effect of shear at the interface can be taken into account directly in the determination of member strength through modeling of the interface slip. The complexity of such an analysis varies greatly based upon whether all components of the composite beams are idealized as linearly elastic (Newmark et al., 1951; Robinson and Naraine, 1988; Viest et al., 1997), or considered using a nonlinear analysis by capturing inelastic behavior of a partially yielded section and nonlinear behavior of the shear connection along the span (Salari et al., 1998; Salari and Spacone, 2001; Zona and Ranzi, 2014). Second, various indirect analytical models have been proposed. Such models aim to provide convenient computational models suitable for routine design use by either idealizing various components of the composite beam as fully elastic or fully plastic and capturing most dominant elements driving the shear connection ductility demand (Oehlers and Sved, 1995) or by parametrically relating the results of rigorous nonlinear finite element analyses to the most critical design properties affecting shear connection ductility through simple algebraic relationships (Johnson and Molenstra, 1991).

Configurations of composite beams as designed in routine practice depend on strength and serviceability requirements, detailing rules, construction sequence, framing details, fabrication logistics, fire rating requirements, as well as various other considerations related to standard practice. For beams that are loaded uniformly or due to equally spaced concentrated loads, such as a typical girder, the studies (Mujagic et al., 2015; Selden et al., 2015) indicate that beams are not susceptible to connector failure due to insufficient deformation capacity, and thus, need not be checked for this limit state if they meet one or more of the following conditions:

(a) Beams with span not exceeding 30 ft (9.1 m);

(b) Beams with a degree of composite action of at least 50%; or

(c) Beams with an average nominal shear connector capacity of at least 16 kip/ft (230 000 N/m) along their shear span, corresponding to a  $ \frac{3}{4} $ -in.- (19-mm-) diameter steel headed stud anchor placed at 12 in. (300 mm) spacing on average.

Beams that do not meet the foregoing criteria or have an unsymmetrical loading configuration may still be acceptable and can be evaluated through direct nonlinear modeling of the member capturing all sources of deformation. Such modeling should be performed under factored loads using strength and stiffness properties of the member. The analysis should meet the pertinent requirements of Appendix 1. Furthermore, the analytical model should be validated using experimental data with respect to the load-deformation properties of both the member global behavior and the behavior of the shear connection at the interface of the slab and beam. Such validation should utilize strength and stiffness properties that match the

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_1.md -->

constitutive models reflected in the actual experimental data. Experimental data providing insight into the load-deformation response of the shear connection and the composite member as a whole is provided by Lyons et al. (1994) and Roddenberry et al. (2002a). As another alternative, the mixed analysis approach provided by Oehlers and Sved (1995) can be used.

When steel headed stud anchors are used on beams with formed steel deck, they may be welded directly through the deck or through prepunched or cut-in-place holes in the deck. The usual procedure is to install steel headed stud anchors by welding directly through the deck. However, special precautions and procedures recommended by the stud manufacturer should be followed when the following conditions exist:

(a) The deck thickness is greater than 16 ga. (1.5 mm) for single thickness or 18 ga. (1.2 mm) for each sheet of double thickness; or

(b) The total thickness of galvanized coating is greater than 1.25 ounces/ft $ ^{2} $  (0.38 kg/m $ ^{2} $ ).

Composite beam tests in which the longitudinal spacing of steel headed stud anchors was varied according to the intensity of the static shear, and duplicate beams in which the anchors were uniformly spaced, exhibited approximately the same ultimate strength and approximately the same amount of deflection at nominal loads. Under distributed load conditions, only a slight deformation in the concrete near the more heavily stressed anchors is needed to redistribute the horizontal shear to other less heavily stressed anchors. The important consideration is that the total number of anchors be sufficient to develop the shear on either side of the point of maximum moment. The provisions of this Specification are based upon this concept of composite action.

### 2. Load Transfer for Negative Flexural Strength

In computing the available flexural strength at points of maximum negative bending, reinforcement parallel to the steel beam within the effective width of the slab may be included, provided such reinforcement is properly anchored beyond the region of negative moment. However, steel anchors are required to transfer the ultimate tensile force in the reinforcement from the slab to the steel beam.

When the steel deck includes units for carrying electrical wiring, crossover headers are commonly installed over the cellular deck perpendicular to the ribs. These create trenches that completely or partially replace sections of the concrete slab above the deck. These trenches, running parallel to or transverse to a composite beam, may reduce the effectiveness of the concrete flange. Without special provisions to replace the concrete displaced by the trench, the trench should be considered as a complete structural discontinuity in the concrete flange.

When trenches are parallel to the composite beam, the effective flange width should be determined from the known position of the trench.

Trenches oriented transverse to composite beams should, if possible, be located in areas of low bending moment and the full required number of studs should be placed between the trench and the point of maximum positive moment. Where the

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_2.md -->

trench cannot be located in an area of low moment, the beam should be designed as noncomposite.

### 3. Encased Composite Members

Tests of concrete-encased beams demonstrate that (a) the encasement drastically reduces the possibility of lateral-torsional instability and prevents local buckling of the encased steel, (b) the restrictions imposed on the encasement practically prevent bond failure prior to first yielding of the steel section, and (c) direct bond interaction between the steel and concrete, without the use of additional anchorage, is insufficient to develop the composite action necessary to achieve the full plastic moment capacity of the composite section (Hawkins, 1973; ASCE, 1979; Juang and Hsu, 2006). Accordingly, this Specification permits three alternative design methods for the determination of the nominal flexural strength: (a) based on an elastic stress distribution using first yield in the tension flange of the composite section; (b) based on the plastic flexural strength of the steel section alone; and (c) based on the strength of the composite section obtained from the plastic stress distribution method or the strain-compatibility method. An assessment of the data indicates that the same resistance and safety factors may be used for all three approaches (Leon et al., 2007). For concrete-encased composite beams, method (c) is applicable only when shear anchors are provided along the steel section and reinforcement of the concrete encasement meets the specified detailing requirements. For concrete-encased composite beams, no limitations are placed on the slenderness of either the composite beam or the elements of the steel section, because the encasement effectively inhibits both local and lateral buckling.

In method (a), stresses on the steel section from permanent loads applied to unshored beams before the concrete has hardened must be superimposed on stresses on the composite section from loads applied to the beams after hardening of the concrete. In this superposition, all permanent loads should be multiplied by the dead load factor and all live loads should be multiplied by the live load factor. For shored beams, all loads may be assumed as resisted by the composite section. Complete interaction (no slip) between the concrete and steel is assumed.

Insufficient research is available to allow coverage of partially composite encased sections subjected to flexure.

Guidelines have been added for longitudinal and transverse steel limits and detailing based on past experience with concrete beams as covered in ACI 318 (ACI, 2019). Absent specific test results, the guidelines in ACI 318 are referenced. A requirement that concrete encased composite beams be tension controlled is provided so that a ductile performance occurs in case of an overload. The area of the steel core is intended to be included in checking this requirement.

### 4. Filled Composite Members

Tests of filled composite beams indicate that (a) the steel HSS drastically reduces the possibility of lateral-torsional instability, (b) the concrete infill changes the local buckling mode of the steel HSS, and (c) direct bond interaction between the steel and concrete, without the use of additional anchorage, is sufficient to develop the composite action necessary to achieve the full plastic moment capacity even for cases with unrestrained slip potential (Lu and Kennedy, 1994; Prion and Boehme,

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_3.md -->

1994; Wheeler and Bridge, 2006; Leon et al., 2007; Lehman et al., 2018a; Kenarangi and Bruneau, 2019).

Figure C-I3.7 shows the variation of the nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , of the filled section with respect to the HSS wall slenderness. As shown, compact composite sections can develop the full plastic strength,  $ M_{p} $ , in flexure. The nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , of noncompact composite sections can be determined using a linear interpolation between the plastic strength,  $ M_{p} $ , and the elastic strength based on the yield strength,  $ M_{y} $ , with respect to the HSS wall slenderness. Slender-element composite sections are limited to developing the first yield moment,  $ M_{cr} $ , of the composite section where the tension flange reaches first yielding, while the compression flange is limited to the critical buckling stress,  $ F_{n} $ , and the concrete is limited to linear elastic behavior with maximum compressive stress equal to  $ 0.7 f_{c}^{\prime} $  (Lai et al., 2014). The nominal flexural strengths calculated using the Specification compare conservatively with experimental results (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015). Figure C-I3.8 shows typical stress blocks for determining the nominal flexural strengths of compact composite, noncompact composite, and slender-element composite filled rectangular box sections.

Longitudinal and transverse reinforcement is not required for filled composite beams. Absent specific research and tests for internally reinforced filled composite beams, reasonable guidelines have been added for the case where internal longitudinal reinforcing steel is added. If internal reinforcement is provided for additional capacity, a minimum longitudinal reinforcing steel ratio of 0.004 is required as a reasonable lower limit based on past experience with concrete encased columns. Minimum transverse steel is required for holding the internal cage in place for constructability. Note that transverse reinforcement does not add significant shear strength to the member. The guidelines in ACI 318 are referenced for an upper-bound limit on longitudinal reinforcement. A requirement that filled composite beams be tension-controlled is therefore provided so that a ductile performance occurs in case of an overload. The area of the steel perimeter is intended to be included in checking this requirement.

### 5. Composite Plate Shear Walls

The flexural capacity of composite plate shear walls can be calculated using a plastic stress distribution over the wall cross section. This is in accordance with Section I1.2a, where the steel yield stress in compression and tension is equal to  $ F_{y} $  and the concrete compressive stress is equal to  $ 0.85f_{c}^{\prime} $ .

### I 4. SHEAR

### 1. Encased Composite Members

Three methods for determining the shear strength of encased composite members are provided:

(a) The intent is to allow the designer to ignore the concrete contribution entirely and simply use the provisions of Chapter G with their associated resistance or safety factors.

(b) When using only the strength of the reinforcing steel and concrete, a resistance factor of 0.75 or the corresponding safety factor of 2.00 is to be applied, which is consistent with ACI 318.

(c) When using the strength of the steel section in combination with the contribution of the transverse reinforcing bars, the nominal shear strength of the steel section alone should be determined according to the provisions of Chapter G and then combined with the nominal shear strength of the transverse reinforcement as determined by ACI 318. This combined nominal strength should then be multiplied by an overall resistance factor of 0.75 or divided by the safety factor of 2.00 to determine the available shear strength of the member.

Though it would be logical to suggest provisions where both the contributions of the steel section and reinforced concrete are superimposed, there is insufficient research available to justify such a combination.

### 2. Filled Composite Members

The shear strength of circular and rectangular filled composite members in flexure is calculated in accordance with this section. Values of  $ K_{c} $  have been established and calibrated considering experimental results (Kenarangi et al., 2021), and data from cyclic testing (Nakahara and Tsumura, 2014; Bruneau et al., 2018; Kenarangi and Bruneau, 2020a, 2020b) and monotonic loading (Xu et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2012; Lehman et al., 2018a, 2018b; Ye et al., 2016) for composite filled round HSS and filled rectangular sections (Koester, 2000; Fischer and Varma, 2015a).

Equation I4-1 combines the plastic shear strength of the steel HSS and the contribution of the concrete fill, which depends on the shear span-to-depth ratio illustrated in Figure C-I4.1. Research has demonstrated that the concrete fill adds substantially to the shear strength of filled composite members. Specimens with and without internal reinforcement were shown to exhibit similar cyclic shear strengths in experiments by Bruneau et al. (2018). The contribution of the internal reinforcement to the total shear strength was found to be marginal compared to the strength provided by the steel HSS, and is, therefore, not part of the design equations.

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_6.md -->

For very short shear spans, the shear behavior is governed by the formation of a strut in the infill concrete. For example, for circular cross sections, the contribution of this diagonal has been reported to be largest for shear span-to-diameter ratio,  $ M_{u}/V_{u}d $ , of 0.25 (Bruneau et al., 2018; Kenarangi and Bruneau, 2020b), progressively decreasing for smaller or greater values of this ratio.

An adequate development length must be present on both sides of a shear region where  $ K_{c} $  greater than 1 is considered. This permits the development of the diagonal strut, which typically flows between compression zones on both sides of the high shear region. Lehman et al. (2018a, 2018b) recommends the use of a minimum development length of 1 times the diameter of a filled round HSS beyond the point of zero moment to the point of maximum moment to achieve the full plastic capacity of the member.

### 3. Composite Beams with Formed Steel Deck

A conservative approach to shear provisions for composite beams with steel headed stud or steel channel anchors is adopted by assigning all shear to the steel section in accordance with Chapter G. This method neglects any concrete contribution and serves to simplify design.

### 4. Composite Plate Shear Walls

The in-plane shear behavior of composite plate shear walls is governed by the plane stress behavior of the plates and the orthotropic elastic behavior of concrete cracked in principal tension. Varma et al. (2014) and Seo et al. (2016) discuss the

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_partly_images/aisc360-22-markdown_AISC 360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_235_710_605_1080.jpg" alt="Image" width="42%" /></div>


Shear span-to-depth ratio:  $ \frac{a}{d}=\frac{(M_{u}/V_{u})}{d}=\frac{M_{u}}{V_{u}d} $ 

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure C-I4.1. Shear span-to-depth ratio for filled composite flexural members.</div>


<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_7.md -->

in-plane shear behavior of composite plate shear walls. The nominal shear force corresponding to the onset of yielding of the steel plates is given by Equation I4-2. The corresponding principal compressive stress in the cracked (orthotropic) concrete is less than  $ 0.7f_{c}^{\prime} $  for typical composite walls with reinforcement ratios,  $ 2t/t_{sc} $ , less than or equal to 10%. For walls with very high reinforcement ratios (in other words, walls with very thick steel plates compared to overall thickness), the concrete principal compressive stress can be the limiting failure criterion (Seo et al., 2016; Varma et al., 2014). The ultimate shear strength of composite walls, beyond the yielding of the steel plates, depends on the compression strut failure of the cracked concrete infill and can be 20 to 30% higher (Booth et al., 2019).

The out-of-plane shear strength of composite plate shear walls rarely governs design. However, if perimeter composite plate shear walls are used on the exterior surfaces of the building, then out-of-plane shear strength may have to be checked for wind pressure. Equations for calculating out-of-plane strength are included in the AISC Specification for Safety-Related Steel Structures for Nuclear Facilities, Section N9.3.5 (AISC, 2018b). The development of these equations is presented in Sener and Varma (2014) and Sener et al. (2015), and their use is demonstrated in AISC Design Guide 32 (Bhardwaj and Varma, 2017).

### I 5. COMBINED FLEXURE AND AXIAL FORCE

Required strengths for composite beam-columns are determined according to the provisions of Chapter C. Section I1.5 provides the appropriate stiffness for composite members to be used with the direct analysis method of Chapter C. For the assessment of available strength, the Specification provisions for interaction between axial force and flexure in composite members are the same as for bare steel members as covered in Section H1.1. The provisions also permit an analysis based on the strength provisions of Section I1.2 that leads to an interaction diagram similar to those used in reinforced concrete design. The latter approach is discussed here.

For encased composite members, the available axial strength, including the effects of buckling, and the available flexural strength can be calculated using either the plastic stress distribution method or the strain-compatibility method (Leon et al., 2007; Leon and Hajjar, 2008). For filled composite members, the available axial and flexural strengths can be calculated using Sections I2.2 and I3.4, respectively, which also include the effects of local buckling for noncompact composite and slender-element composite sections classified according to Section I1.4.

The following commentary describes three different approaches to designing composite beam-columns that are applicable to both concrete-encased steel shapes and compact composite filled HSS, and a fourth approach that is applicable to noncompact composite or slender-element composite filled sections. The first two approaches are based on variations in the plastic stress distribution method while the third method references AISC Design Guide 6, Load and Resistance Factor Design of W-Shapes Encased in Concrete (Griffis, 1992), which is based on an earlier version of the Specification. The strain compatibility method is similar to that used in the design of concrete compression members as specified in ACI 318, Chapter 22 (ACI, 2019).

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_8.md -->

Method 1—Interaction Equations of Section H1.1. The first approach applies to doubly symmetric composite beam-columns, the most common geometry found in building construction. For this case, the interaction equations of Section H1.1 provide a conservative assessment of the available strength of the member for combined axial compression and flexure as illustrated in Figure C-I5.1. These provisions may also be used for combined axial tension and flexure. The degree of conservatism generally depends on the extent of concrete contribution to the overall strength relative to the steel contribution. The larger the load-carrying contribution coming from the steel section, the less conservative the strength prediction of the interaction equations from Section H1.1. Thus, for example, the equations are generally more conservative for members with high concrete compressive strength as compared to members with low concrete compressive strength. The advantages of this method include the following: (a) the same interaction equations used for steel beam-columns are applicable; and (b) only two anchor points are needed to define the interaction curves—one for pure flexure (point B) and one for pure axial load (point A). Point A is determined using Equations I2-2 or I2-3, as applicable. Note that slenderness must also be considered using the provisions of Section I2. Point B is determined as the flexural strength of the section according to the provisions of Section I3.

The nominal strengths predicted using the equations of Section H1.1 compare conservatively with a wide range of experimental data for noncompact and slender-element composite rectangular and round filled sections (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015).

Method 2—Interaction Curves from the Plastic Stress Distribution Method. The second approach applies to doubly symmetric encased and compact filled composite beam-columns and is based on developing interaction surfaces for combined axial compression and flexure at the nominal strength level using the plastic stress distribution method. This approach results in interaction surfaces similar to those shown in Figure C-I5.2. The four points, A through D, identified in Figure C-I5.2,

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_partly_images/aisc360-22-markdown_AISC 360-22w_part_18_img_in_chart_box_248_826_615_1162.jpg" alt="Image" width="42%" /></div>

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_9.md -->

are defined by the plastic stress distribution used in their determination. The strength equations for encased W-shapes and filled HSS shapes used to define each point are provided in the AISC Steel Construction Manual Part 6 (AISC, 2017). Point A is the pure axial strength determined according to Section I2. Point B is determined as the flexural strength of the section according to the provisions of Section I3. Point C corresponds to a plastic neutral axis location that results in the same flexural strength as point B, but including axial compression. Point D corresponds to an axial compressive strength of one-half of that determined for point C. An additional point E, as shown in Figure C-I1.1(b), is included (between points A and C) for encased W-shapes bent about their weak axis. Point E is an arbitrary point, generally corresponding to a plastic neutral axis location at the flange tips of the encased W-shape, used to better reflect bending strength for weak-axis bending of encased shapes. Linear interpolation between these anchor points may be used. However, with this approach, care should be taken in reducing point D by a resistance factor or to account for member slenderness, as this may lead to an unsafe situation whereby additional flexural strength is permitted at a lower axial compressive strength than predicted by the cross-section strength of the member. This potential problem may be avoided through a simplification to this method whereby point D is removed from the interaction surface. Figure C-I5.3 demonstrates this simplification with the vertical dashed line that connects point C" to point B". Once the nominal strength interaction surface is determined, length effects according to Equations I2-2 and I2-3 must be applied to obtain points A' through E'. Note that the same slenderness reduction factor  $ (\lambda = A'/A $  in Figure C-I5.2, equal to  $ P_n/P_{no} $ , where  $ P_n $  and  $ P_{no} $  are calculated from Section I2) applies to points A, C, D, and E. The available strength is then determined by applying the compression and flexure resistance factors or safety factors to points A" through E".

 $$ \mathsf{A}^{\prime}=\lambda\mathsf{A} $$ 

 $$ \mathsf{A}^{\prime\prime}=\Phi\mathsf{A}^{\prime} $$

Using linear interpolation between points A", C", and B" in Figure C-I5.3, the following interaction equations may be derived for composite beam-columns subjected to combined axial compression plus biaxial flexure:

(a) If  $ P_{r} < P_{C} $

Method 3—Design Guide 6. The approach presented in AISC Design Guide 6 (Griffis, 1992) may also be used to determine the beam-column strength of encased W-shapes. Although this method is based on an earlier version of the Specification, available axial and flexural strengths can conservatively be determined directly from the tables in this design guide. The difference in resistance factors from the earlier Specification may safely be ignored.

Method 4—Direct Interaction Method for Noncompact Composite and Slender-Element Composite Filled Sections. For filled noncompact composite and slender-element composite members, the interaction equations in Section H1.1 can be conservative (Lai et al., 2016). The interaction between axial compression, P, and flexure, M, in filled composite members is typically seen to vary with the strength ratio,  $ c_{sr} $ , which is calculated using Equation I5-2 as the yield strength of the steel components divided by the compressive strength of the concrete component. As the  $ c_{sr} $  ratio increases, the steel component dominates. As the ratio decreases, the concrete component dominates.

This behavior is illustrated in Figure C-I5.4, which shows interaction curves developed using Equations I5-1a and b. Lai et al. (2016) developed these equations as a bilinear simplification of the parabolic P-M interaction curves for filled composite members with noncompact composite or slender-element composite cross sections. The three anchor points of the normalized interaction curve include (a) the member available axial compressive strength as a column,  $ P_{c} $ , determined using Section I2.2b; (b) the member available flexural strength,  $ M_{c} $ , determined using Section I3.4;

and (c) the balance point with coordinates  $ (c_{m}, c_{p}) $ . The balance point coordinates are functions of the strength ratio,  $ c_{sr} $ , and calculated using Table I5.1 for rectangular and round filled composite members.

The interaction curve developed using Equations I5-1a and b is recommended for noncompact or slender-element filled composite members: (a) with governing unsupported length-to-diameter, L/D, or length-to-width, L/B, ratios less than or equal to 20; and (b) not providing stability support to gravity-only columns with significant axial loading. In situations where (a) and (b) are not met, the balance point with coordinates  $ (c_{m}, c_{p}) $  may be reduced further due to slenderness effects. This potential problem can be addressed through the simplified method described earlier and shown in Figure C-I5.3, where the increased available flexural strength due to axial compression is removed from the interaction curve.

The flexural capacity of composite plate shear walls subjected to axial compression can be estimated using the plastic stress distribution method of Section I1.2a, or the effective stress-strain method of Section I1.2d (Bruneau et al., 2019; Shafaei et al., 2021a, b). Bruneau et al. (2019) and Shafaei et al. (2021a) have reported the results of experimental investigations on planar walls subjected to different axial load and cyclic lateral loading up to failure.

### I 6. LOAD TRANSFER

### 1. General Requirements

External forces are typically applied to composite members through direct connection to the steel member, bearing on the concrete, or a combination thereof. Design of the connection for force application follows the requirements for the applicable limit states within Chapters J and K of the Specification as well as the provisions of Section I6. Note that for concrete bearing checks on filled composite members, confinement can affect the bearing strength for external force application as discussed in Commentary Section I6.2.

Once a load path has been provided for the introduction of external forces to the member, the interface between the concrete and steel must be designed to transfer the longitudinal shear required to obtain force equilibrium within the composite section. Section I6.2 contains provisions for determining the magnitude of longitudinal shear to be transferred between the steel and concrete depending upon the external force application condition. Section I6.3 contains provisions addressing mechanisms for the transfer of longitudinal shear.

The load transfer provisions of this section are primarily intended for the transfer of longitudinal shear due to applied axial forces. Load transfer of longitudinal shear due to applied bending moments in encased and filled composite members is beyond the scope of this section; however, tests (Lu and Kennedy, 1994; Prion and Boehme, 1994; Wheeler and Bridge, 2006) indicate that filled composite members can develop their full plastic moment capacity based on bond alone without the use of additional anchorage.

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_13.md -->

Composite column base connections are another aspect of load transfer that is not addressed directly by the Specification. As with all frame systems, selecting and proportioning base connections is a critical aspect of the design process. Load paths are required to transfer the internal forces from each component of a composite column (in other words, structural steel, concrete, and reinforcing steel) to the supporting element(s). Several connection types have been proposed in the literature ranging from standard base plate connections (similar to those common for structural steel columns) to embedded connections of various configurations. Not all the proposed connections are capable of developing the full strength of the composite column. Hitaka et al. (2003) and Stephens et al. (2016) describe the practical limitations of several types of these connections.

### 2. Force Allocation

This Specification addresses conditions in which the entire external force is applied to the steel or concrete as well as conditions in which the external force is applied to both materials concurrently. The provisions are based upon the assumption that in order to achieve equilibrium across the cross section, transfer of longitudinal shears along the interface between the concrete and steel shall occur such that the resulting force levels within the two materials may be proportioned according to the relative cross-sectional strength contributions of each material. Load allocation based on the cross-sectional strength contribution model is represented by Equations I6-1 and I6-2. Equation I6-1 represents the magnitude of force that is present within the concrete encasement or concrete fill at equilibrium. The longitudinal shear generated by loads applied directly to the steel section is determined based on the amount of force to be distributed to the concrete according to Equation I6-1. Conversely, when load is applied to the concrete section only, the longitudinal shear required for cross-sectional equilibrium is based upon the amount of force to be distributed to the steel according to Equation I6-2. Where loads are applied concurrently to the two materials, the longitudinal shear force to be transferred to achieve cross-sectional equilibrium can be taken as either the difference in magnitudes between the portion of external force applied directly to the concrete and that required by Equation I6-1 or the portion of external force applied directly to the steel section and that required by Equations I6-2a and b. For filled composite members, the steel contribution to the overall nominal axial compressive strength of the cross section decreases with increasing slenderness ratio  $ (b/t $  or  $ D/t) $ . As a result, it is not permitted to apply axial force directly to the steel wall of filled composite sections classified as slender-element composite because the stress concentrations associated with force application could cause premature local buckling. Additionally, the magnitude of longitudinal shears required to be transferred to the concrete infill would require impractical load transfer lengths.

When external forces are applied to the concrete of a filled composite member via bearing, it is acceptable to assume that adequate confinement is provided by the steel encasement to allow the maximum available bearing strength permitted by Equation J8-2 to be used. This strength is obtained by setting the term  $ \sqrt{A_{2}/A_{1}} $  equal to 2. This discussion is in reference to the introduction of external load to the compression member. The transfer of longitudinal shear within the compression member via bearing mechanisms, such as internal steel plates, is addressed in Section I6.3a.

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_14.md -->

The Specification provisions assume that the required external force to be allocated imparts compression to the composite section. For applied tensile force, it is generally acceptable to design the component of the composite member to which the force is applied (in other words, either the steel section or the longitudinal reinforcement) to resist the entire tensile force, and no further force transfer calculations are necessary. For atypical conditions where the magnitude of required external tensile force necessitates the use of longitudinal reinforcement in conjunction with the steel section, force allocation to each component may be determined as follows.

When the entire external tensile force is applied directly to the steel section,

 $$ V_{r}^{\prime}=P_{r}\Big(1-F_{y}A_{s}/P_{n}\Big) $$ 

When the entire external tensile force is applied directly to the longitudinal reinforcement,

 $$ V_{r}^{\prime}=P_{r}\left(F_{y}A_{s}/P_{n}\right) $$ 

where

 $ P_{n} $  = nominal axial tensile strength, determined by Equation I2-8 for encased composite members, and Equation I2-14 for filled composite members, kips (N)

 $ P_{r}= $  required external tensile force applied to the composite member, kips (N)

 $ V_{r}^{\prime}= $  required longitudinal shear force to be transferred to the steel section or longitudinal reinforcement, kips (N)

Where longitudinal reinforcing bars are used to resist tension forces, they must use appropriate lap splices in accordance with ACI 318 (ACI, 2019) as directed by Section I1. For sustained tension, mechanical splices are required by ACI 318, Section 25.5.7.4.

### 3. Force Transfer Mechanisms

Transfer of longitudinal shear by direct bearing via internal bearing mechanisms, such as internal bearing plates or shear connection via steel anchors, is permitted for both filled and encased composite members. Transfer of longitudinal shear via direct bond interaction is permitted solely for compact and noncompact filled composite members. Although it is recognized that force transfer also occurs by direct bond interaction between the steel and concrete for encased composite columns, this mechanism is typically ignored and shear transfer is generally carried out solely with steel anchors (Griffis, 1992).

The use of the force transfer mechanism providing the largest resistance is permissible. Superposition of force transfer mechanisms is not permitted as the experimental data indicate that direct bearing or shear connection often does not initiate until after direct bond interaction has been breached, and little experimental data is available regarding the interaction of direct bearing and shear connection via steel anchors.

The restriction, added in this edition of the Specification, that direct bond interaction shall not be used for filled composite members where bond failure could result in uncontrolled slip, is intended to prevent reliance on this mechanism in cases, such as tension hangers, where static equilibrium cannot be achieved after limited slip.

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_15.md -->

### 3 a. Direct Bearing

For the general condition of load applied directly to concrete in bearing, and considering a supporting concrete area that is wider on all sides than the loaded area, the nominal bearing strength for concrete is given by Equation J8-2:

 $$ R_{n}=0.85f_{c}^{\prime}A_{1}\sqrt{A_{1}/A_{2}}\leq1.7f_{c}^{\prime}A_{1} $$ 

where

 $ A_{1}= $  loaded area of concrete, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

$A_{2} = \text{maximum area of the portion of the supporting surface that is geometrically similar to and concentric with the loaded area, in.}^{2} (\text{mm}^{2})$

 $ f_{c}^{\prime} $  = specified compressive concrete strength, ksi (MPa)

The value of  $ \sqrt{A_{2}/A_{1}} $  must be less than or equal to 2 (ACI, 2019).

For the specific condition of transferring longitudinal shear by direct bearing via internal bearing mechanisms, Equation I6-3 uses the maximum nominal bearing strength allowed by Equation J8-2 of  $ 1.7f_{c}^{\prime}A_{1} $ . The resistance factor for bearing on concrete,  $ \phi_{B} $ , is 0.65 (and the safety factor for bearing on concrete,  $ \Omega_{B} $ , is 2.31) in accordance with Section J8.

### 3 b. Shear Connection

Steel anchors shall be designed according to the provisions for composite components in Section I8.3.

### 3 c. Direct Bond Interaction

Force transfer by direct bond is commonly used in filled composite members as long as the connections are detailed to limit local deformations (API, 1993; Roeder et al., 1999). While chemical adhesion provides some contribution, direct bond is primarily a frictional resistance mechanism. There is large scatter in the experimental data on the bond of filled composite compression members; however, some trends have been identified (Roeder et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2012). Larger cross sections, thinner walls, rectangular shapes, smoothed or oiled interfaces, and high-shrinkage concrete contribute to lower apparent bond strengths. Smaller cross sections, thicker walls, circular shapes, rougher interfaces, expansive concrete, and the presence of bending moment (including eccentric loading such as from shear tabs) contribute to higher apparent bond strengths.

The equations for direct bond interaction for filled composite compression members assume the entire interface perimeter is engaged in the transfer of stress. Accordingly, the strength is compared to the sum of the force required to be transferred from connecting elements framing in from all sides. The scatter in the experimental data leads to the recommended low value of the resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , and the corresponding high value of the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ .

### 4. Detailing Requirements

To avoid overstressing the structural steel section or the concrete at connections in encased or filled composite members, transfer of longitudinal shear is required to occur within the load introduction length. The load introduction length is taken as

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_16.md -->

2 times the minimum transverse dimension of the composite member both above and below the load transfer region. The load transfer region is generally taken as the depth of the connecting element as indicated in Figure C-I6.1. In cases where the applied forces are of such a magnitude that the required longitudinal shear transfer cannot take place within the prescribed load introduction length, the designer should treat the compression member as noncomposite along the additional length required for shear transfer.

For encased composite members, steel anchors are required throughout the compression member length to maintain composite action of the member under incidental moments (including flexure induced by incipient buckling). These anchors are typically placed at the maximum permitted spacing according to Section I8.3e. Additional anchors required for longitudinal shear transfer shall be located within the load introduction length as described previously.

Unlike concrete encased members, steel anchors in filled members are required only when used for longitudinal shear transfer and are not required along the length of the member outside of the introduction region. This difference is due to the adequate confinement provided by the steel encasement which prevents the loss of composite action under incidental moments.

### I 7. COMPOSITE DIAPHRAGMS AND COLLECTOR BEAMS

In composite construction, floor or roof slabs consisting of composite metal deck and concrete fill are typically connected to the structural framing to form composite

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_partly_images/aisc360-22-markdown_AISC 360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_206_686_653_1169.jpg" alt="Image" width="51%" /></div>

diaphragms. Diaphragms are horizontally spanning members, analogous to deep beams, which distribute lateral loads from their origin to the lateral force-resisting system either directly or in combination with load transfer elements known as collectors or collector beams (also known as diaphragm struts and drag struts).

Diaphragms serve the important structural function of interconnecting the components of a structure to help it behave as a unit. Diaphragms are commonly analyzed as simple-span or continuously spanning deep beams, and hence, are subjected to shear, moment, and axial forces, as well as the associated deformations. Further information on diaphragm classifications and behavior can be found in AISC (2018a) and SDI (2015).

Composite Diaphragm Strength. Diaphragms should be designed to resist all forces associated with the collection and distribution of lateral forces to the lateral force-resisting system. In some cases, loads from other floors should also be included, such as at a level where a horizontal offset in the lateral force-resisting system exists. Several methods exist for determining the in-place shear strength of composite diaphragms. Three such methods are as follows:

(a) As determined for the combined strength of composite deck and concrete fill, including the considerations of composite deck configuration, as well as type and layout of deck attachments. One publication that is considered to provide such guidance is the SDI Diaphragm Design Manual (SDI, 2015). This publication covers many aspects of diaphragm design, including strength and stiffness calculations. Calculation procedures are also provided for alternative deck-to-framing connection methods, such as puddle welding and mechanical fasteners in cases where anchors are not used. Where stud anchors are used, stud shear strength values shall be as determined according to Section I8.

(b) As the thickness of concrete over the steel deck is increased, the shear strength can approach that for a concrete slab of the same thickness. For example, in composite floor deck diaphragms having cover depths between 2 in. (50 mm) and 6 in. (150 mm), measured shear stresses on the order of  $ 0.11\sqrt{f_{c}^{\prime}} $ , where  $ \sqrt{f_{c}^{\prime}} $  is in units of ksi, have been reported. In such cases, the diaphragm strength of concrete metal deck slabs can conservatively be based on the principles of reinforced concrete design (ACI, 2019) using the concrete and reinforcement above the metal deck ribs and ignoring the beneficial effect of the concrete in the flutes.

(c) Results from in-plane tests of filled diaphragms.

Collector Beams and Other Composite Elements. Horizontal diaphragm forces are transferred to the steel lateral force-resisting frame as axial forces in collector beams, which are also known as diaphragm struts or drag struts. The design of collector beams has not been addressed directly in this chapter. The rigorous design of composite collector beams is complex and few detailed guidelines exist on such members. Until additional research becomes available, a reasonable simplified design approach is provided as follows:

Force Application. Collector beams can be designed for the combined effects of axial load due to diaphragm forces, as well as flexure due to gravity and/or lateral loads. The effect of the vertical offset (eccentricity) between the plane of the diaphragm

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_18.md -->

and the centerline of the collector element results in additional shear reactions that should be investigated for design.

Axial Strength. The available axial strength of collector beams can be determined according to the noncomposite provisions of Chapter D and Chapter E. For compressive loading, collector beams are generally considered unbraced for buckling between braced points about their strong axis and fully braced by the composite diaphragm for buckling about the weak axis. The limit state of flexural-torsional buckling with bracing offset from the shear center, as addressed in Section E4, may also apply.

Flexural Strength. The available flexural strength of collector beams can be determined using either the composite provisions of Chapter I or the noncomposite provisions of Chapter F. It is recommended that all collector beams, even those designed as noncomposite members, should consider shear connector slip capacity as discussed in Commentary Section I3. This recommendation is intended to prevent designers from utilizing a small number of anchors solely to transfer diaphragm forces on a beam designed as a noncomposite member. Anchors designed only to transfer horizontal shear due to lateral forces will still be subjected to horizontal shear due to flexure from gravity loads superimposed on the composite section and could become overloaded under gravity loading conditions. Overloading the anchors could result in loss of stud strength, which could inhibit the ability of the collector beam to function as required for the transfer of diaphragm forces due to lateral loads.

Interaction. Combined axial force and flexure can be assessed using the interaction equations provided in Chapter H. As a reasonable simplification for design purposes, it is acceptable to use the noncomposite axial strength and the composite flexural strength in combination for determining interaction.

Shear Connection. It is not required to superimpose the horizontal shear due to lateral forces with the horizontal shear due to flexure for the determination of steel anchor requirements. The reasoning behind this methodology is twofold. First, the load combinations as presented in ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022) provide reduced live load levels for load combinations containing lateral loads. This reduction decreases the demand on the steel anchors and provides additional capacity for diaphragm force transfer. Secondly, horizontal shear due to flexure in a simply supported member flows in two directions. For a uniformly loaded beam, the shear flow emanates outward from the center of the beam as illustrated in Figure C-I7.1(a). Lateral loads on collector beams induce shear in one direction. As these shears are superimposed, the horizontal shears on one portion of the beam are increased and the horizontal shears on the opposite portion of the beam are decreased as illustrated in Figure C-I7.1(b). In lieu of additional research, it is considered acceptable for the localized additional loading of the steel anchors in the additive beam segment to be considered offset by the concurrent unloading of the steel anchors in the subtractive beam segment up to a force level corresponding to the summation of the nominal strengths of all studs placed on the beam. It is considered that the shear connectors in typical practical configurations possess an adequate degree of slip capacity to accommodate this mechanism.

### I 8. STEEL ANCHORS

### 1. General

This section covers the strength, placement, and limitations on the use of steel anchors in composite construction. The term "steel anchor," first introduced in the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), includes the traditional "shear connector," now defined as a "steel headed stud anchor" and a "steel channel anchor" both of which have been part of previous Specifications. Both steel headed stud anchors and hot-rolled steel channel anchors are addressed in the Specification. The design provisions for steel anchors are given for composite beams with solid slabs or with formed steel deck and for composite components. A composite component is defined as a member, connecting element, or assemblage in which steel and concrete elements work as a unit in the distribution of internal forces. This term excludes composite beams with solid slabs or formed steel deck. The provisions for composite components include the use of a resistance factor or safety factor applied to the nominal strength of the steel anchor, while for composite beams, the resistance factor and safety factor are part of the composite beam resistance and safety factor.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_partly_images/aisc360-22-markdown_AISC 360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_158_551_705_782.jpg" alt="Image" width="63%" /></div>

Steel headed stud anchors up to 1 in. (25 mm) in diameter are permitted for use in beams with solid slabs based on a review of available data and their history of successful performance in bridge applications. The limitation of  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm) anchors for all other conditions represents the limits of push-out data for decked members as well as the limits of applicability of the current composite component provisions. Though larger anchors for use in composite components are not addressed by this Specification, their strength may be determined by ACI 318, Chapter 17 (ACI, 2019).

Studs not located directly over the web of a beam tend to tear out of a thin flange before attaining full shear strength. To guard against this contingency, the size of a stud not located over the beam web is limited to  $ 2\frac{1}{2} $  times the flange thickness (Goble, 1968). The practical application of this limitation is to select only beams with flanges thicker than the stud diameter divided by 2.5.

Section I8.2 requires a minimum overall steel headed stud anchor height to the shank diameter ratio of 4 when calculating the nominal shear strength of a steel headed stud anchor in a composite beam. This requirement has been used in previous Specifications and has had a record of successful performance. For calculating the nominal shear strength of a steel headed stud anchor in other composite components, Section I8.3 increases this minimum ratio to 5 for normal weight concrete and 7 for lightweight concrete. Additional increases in the minimum ratio are required for computing the nominal tensile strength or the nominal strength for interaction of shear and tension in Section I8.3. The provisions of Section I8.3 also establish minimum edge distances and center-to-center spacings for steel headed stud anchors if the nominal strength equations in that section are to be used. These limits are established in recognition of the fact that only steel failure modes are checked in the calculation of the nominal anchor strengths in Equations I8-3, I8-4, and I8-5. Concrete failure modes are not checked explicitly in these equations (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a, 2010b), whereas concrete failure is checked in Equation I8-1. This is discussed further in Commentary Section I8.3.

### 2. Steel Anchors in Composite Beams

### 2 a. Strength of Steel Headed Stud Anchors

The present strength equations for composite beams and steel headed stud anchors are based on the considerable research that has been published, such as Jayas and Hosain (1988a, 1988b), Mottram and Johnson (1990), Easterling et al. (1993), and Roddenberry et al. (2002a). Equation I8-1 contains  $ R_{g} $  and  $ R_{p} $  factors to bring these composite beam strength requirements to a comparable level with other codes around the world. Other codes use a stud strength expression similar to this Specification, but the stud strength is reduced by a  $ \phi $  factor of 0.8 in the Canadian code (CSA, 2009) and by an even lower partial safety factor,  $ \phi = 0.60 $ , for the corresponding stud strength equations in Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2009). This Specification includes the stud anchor resistance factor as part of the overall composite beam resistance factor.

The majority of composite steel floor decks used today have a stiffening rib in the middle of each deck flute. Because of the stiffener, studs must be welded off-center in the deck rib. Studies have shown that steel studs behave differently depending upon their location within the deck rib (Lawson, 1992; Easterling et al., 1993;

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_21.md -->

Van der Sanden, 1996; Yuan, 1996; Johnson and Yuan, 1998; Roddenberry et al., 2002a, 2002b). The so-called "weak" (unfavorable) and "strong" (favorable) positions are illustrated in Figure C-I8.1. Furthermore, the maximum value shown in these studies for studs welded through steel deck is on the order of 0.7 to  $ 0.75F_{u}A_{sc} $ . Studs placed in the weak position have strengths as low as  $ 0.5F_{u}A_{sc} $ .

The strength of steel headed stud anchors installed in the ribs of concrete slabs on formed steel deck with the ribs oriented perpendicular to the steel beam is reasonably estimated by the strength of steel headed stud anchors computed from Equation I8-1, which sets the default value for steel headed stud anchor strength equal to that for the weak stud position. Both AISC (1997a) and the Steel Deck Institute (SDI, 2001) recommend that studs be detailed in the strong position, but ensuring that studs are placed in the strong position is not necessarily an easy task because it is not always easy for the installer to determine where along the beam the particular rib is located relative to the end, midspan, or point of zero shear. Therefore, the installer may not be clear on which location is the strong and which is the weak position.

In most composite floors designed today, the ultimate strength of the composite section is governed by the strength of the shear connection, as full composite action is typically not the most economical solution to resist the required strength. The degree of composite action, as represented by the ratio of the total shear connection strength divided by the lesser of the yield strength of the steel cross section and the compressive strength of the concrete slab,  $ \Sigma Q_{n}/\left[\min\left(F_{y}A_{s},0.85f_{c}^{\prime}A_{c}\right)\right] $ , influences the flexural strength as shown in Figure C-I8.2.

It can be seen from Figure C-I8.2 that a relatively large change in shear connection strength results in a much smaller change in flexural strength. Thus, formulating the influence of steel deck on shear anchor strength by conducting beam tests and back-calculating through the flexural model, as was done in the past, leads to an inaccurate assessment of stud strength when installed in metal deck.

The changes in steel headed stud anchor requirements that occurred in the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b) were not a result of either structural failures or performance problems. Designers concerned about the strength of existing structures based on earlier Specification requirements should note that the slope of the curve shown in Figure C-I8.2 is rather flat as the degree of composite action approaches one. Thus, even a large change in steel stud strength does not result in a proportional decrease of the flexural strength. In addition, the current expression does not account

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_partly_images/aisc360-22-markdown_AISC 360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_188_1005_673_1171.jpg" alt="Image" width="56%" /></div>

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_22.md -->

for all the possible shear force transfer mechanisms, primarily because many of them are difficult or impossible to quantify. However, as noted in Commentary Section I3.1, as the degree of composite action decreases, the deformation demands on steel studs increase. This effect is reflected by the increasing slope of the relationship shown in Figure C-I8.2 as the degree of composite action decreases. Thus, designers should consider the influence of increased ductility demand, when evaluating existing composite beams with less than 50% composite action.

The reduction factor,  $ R_{p} $ , for steel headed stud anchors used in composite beams with no decking was reduced from 1.0 to 0.75 in the 2010 AISC Specification. The methodology used for steel headed stud anchors that incorporates  $ R_{g} $  and  $ R_{p} $  was implemented in the 2005 AISC Specification. The research (Roddenberry et al., 2002a) in which the factors  $ R_{g} $  and  $ R_{p} $  were developed focused almost exclusively on cases involving the use of steel headed stud anchors welded through the steel deck. The research pointed to the likelihood that the solid slab case should use  $ R_{p} = 0.75 $ ; however, the body of test data had not been established to support the change. More recent research has shown that the 0.75 factor is appropriate (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a).

### 2 b. Strength of Steel Channel Anchors

Equation I8-2 is a modified form of the formula for the strength of channel anchors presented in Slutter and Driscoll (1965), which was based on the results of pushout tests and a few simply supported beam tests with solid slabs by Viest et al. (1952). The modification has extended its use to lightweight concrete.

Eccentricities need not be considered in the weld design for cases where the welds at the toe and heel of the channel are greater than  $ \frac{3}{16} $  in. (5 mm) and the anchor meets the following requirements:

 $$ 1.0\leq\frac{t_{f}}{t_{w}}\leq5.5 $$

 $$ \frac{L_{c}}{t_{f}}\geq6.0 $$

H = height of anchor, in. (mm)

 $ L_{c}= $  length of anchor, in. (mm)

R = radius of the fillet between the flange and the web of the channel anchor, in. (mm)

tf = thickness of channel anchor flange, in. (mm)

 $ t_{w} $  = thickness of channel anchor web, in. (mm)

### 2 d. Detailing Requirements

Uniform spacing of steel anchors is permitted, except in the presence of heavy concentrated loads.

The minimum distances from the center of an anchor to a free edge in the direction of the shear force that are shown in this Specification are based on data reported by Nelson Stud Welding Division (Nelson, 1977). Data for various steel headed stud anchor diameters, concrete compressive strengths, and unit weights are reported. The provisions selected for inclusion in this Specification result in no reduced strength for  $ \frac{3}{4} $ -in.- (19-mm-) diameter steel headed stud anchors in 4 ksi (28 MPa) concrete, which were deemed to be representative of most composite beam construction. Other values are available in the report for use by the designer if deemed to be more applicable.

The minimum spacing of anchors along the length of the beam, in both flat soffit concrete slabs and in formed steel deck with ribs parallel to the beam, is six diameters (6d); this spacing reflects the development of shear planes in the concrete slab (Ollgaard et al., 1971). Because most test data are based on the minimum transverse spacing of four diameters (4d), this transverse spacing was set as the minimum permitted. If the steel beam flange is narrow, this spacing requirement may be achieved by staggering the studs with a minimum transverse spacing of three diameters (3d) between the staggered row of studs. When deck ribs are parallel to the beam and the design requires more studs than can be placed in the rib, the deck may be split so that adequate spacing is available for stud installation. Figure C-I8.3 shows possible anchor arrangements.

### 3. Steel Anchors in Composite Components

This section applies to steel headed stud anchors used primarily in the load transfer (connection) region of composite compression members and beam-columns, encased and filled composite beams, composite coupling beams, and composite walls, where the steel and concrete are working compositely within a member. An example of the use of steel headed stud anchors in a composite wall is shown in Figure C-I8.4. In such cases, it is possible that the steel headed stud anchor will be subjected to shear, tension, or interaction of shear and tension. As the strength of the steel headed stud anchors in the load transfer region must be assessed directly, rather than implicitly within the strength assessment of a composite member, a resistance or safety factor should be applied, comparable to the design of bolted connections in Chapter J.

These provisions are not intended for hybrid construction where the steel and concrete are not working compositely, such as with embed plates. Section I8.2 specifies the strength of steel headed stud anchors embedded in a solid concrete slab or in a concrete slab with formed steel deck in a composite beam.

Data from a wide range of experiments indicate that the failure of steel headed stud anchors subjected to shear occurs in the steel shank or weld in a large percentage of cases if the ratio of the overall height-to-shank diameter of the steel headed stud anchor is greater than 5 for normal weight concrete. In the case of lightweight concrete, the necessary minimum ratio between the overall height of the stud and the diameter increases up to 7 (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a). Use of anchors meeting the dimensional limitations for shear loading preclude the limit state of concrete pryout as defined by ACI 318, Chapter 17 (ACI, 2019). A similarly large percentage of failures occur in the steel shank or weld of steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension or interaction of shear and tension if the ratio of the overall height to shank diameter of the steel headed stud anchor is greater than 8 for normal weight concrete. In the case of lightweight concrete, the necessary minimum ratio between the overall height of the stud and the diameter increases up to 10 for steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010b). For steel headed stud anchors subjected to interaction of shear and tension in lightweight concrete, there are so few experiments available that it is not possible to discern sufficiently when the steel material will control the failure mode. For the strength of steel headed stud anchors

in lightweight concrete subjected to interaction of shear and tension, it is recommended that the provisions of ACI 318, Chapter 17, be used. Use of steel headed stud anchors meeting the dimensional limitations for tension loading preclude the limit states of concrete breakout and pryout as defined by ACI 318, Chapter 17, where analysis indicates no cracking at service load levels, as would generally be the case in compression zones and regions of high confinement typical of composite construction. Where the engineer determines that concrete cracking under service load levels can occur, it is recommended that the provisions of ACI 318, Chapter 17, be used.

The use of edge distances in ACI 318, Chapter 17, to compute the strength of a steel anchor subjected to concrete crushing failure is complex. It is rare in composite construction that there is a nearby edge that is not uniformly supported in a way that prevents the possibility of concrete breakout failure due to a close edge. Thus, for brevity, the provisions in this Specification simplify the assessment of whether it is warranted to check for a concrete failure mode. Additionally, if an edge is supported uniformly, as would be common in composite construction, it is assumed that a concrete failure mode will not occur due to the edge condition. Thus, if these provisions are to be used, it is important that it be deemed by the engineer that a concrete breakout failure mode in shear is directly avoided through having the edges perpendicular to the line of force supported, and the edges parallel to the line of force sufficiently distant that concrete breakout through a side edge is not deemed viable. For loading in shear, the determination of whether breakout failure in the concrete is a viable

failure mode for the steel headed stud anchor is left to the engineer. Alternatively, the provisions call for required anchor reinforcement with provisions comparable to those of ACI 318, Section 17.5.2.1. In addition, the provisions of the applicable building code or ACI 318, Chapter 17, may be used directly to compute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor.

The steel limit states, resistance factors, and corresponding safety factors covered in this section match with the corresponding limit states of ACI 318, Chapter 17, although they were assessed independently for these provisions. As only steel limit states are required to be checked if there are no edge conditions, experiments that satisfy the minimum height-to-diameter ratio, but that included failure of the steel headed stud anchor either in the steel or in the concrete, were included in the assessment of the resistance and safety factors (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a, 2010b).

For steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension or combined shear and tension interaction, it is recommended that anchor reinforcement always be included around the stud to mitigate premature failure in the concrete. If the ratio of the diameter of the head of the stud to the shank diameter is too small, the provisions call for use of ACI 318, Chapter 17, to compute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor. If the distance to the edge of the concrete or the distance to the neighboring anchor is too small, the provisions call for required anchor reinforcement with provisions comparable to those of ACI 318, Section 17.5.2.1. Alternatively, the provisions of the applicable building code or ACI 318, Chapter 17, may also be used directly to compute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor.

### 4. Performance-Based Alternative for the Design of Shear Connection

In 2022, provisions for performance-based design of the shear connection were introduced. The provisions provide requirements for quantifying the mechanical properties of the shear connection. They can be used to overcome the geometric limitations, such as deck profile height or connector spacing contained in Sections I3.2c, I8.1, and I8.2. Furthermore, the same principle applies to the material limitations of the shear connection types currently prescribed by the Specification. Also, they can be used to quantify the necessary design parameters for alternatives, such as those incorporating nonwelded fasteners, welded plate connectors, specific geometric features of the formed steel deck, etc. Another benefit of the performance-based evaluation path is the ability to directly capture incidental contribution on the performance of various elements of the shear connection assembly, such as the deck profile, otherwise not explicitly recognized by the Specification. Finally, accuracy, reliability, and economy can be improved by generating available strength, performance characteristics, and constitutive models relative to each individual configuration of shear connection. The intent of the provisions prescribing performance-based alternatives for the design of the shear connection is not to alter the specification provision governing the determination of flexural strength of the composite member whose shear connection strength is established through the performance-based path.

These provisions provide two implementation paths—one based on assurance of equivalent performance relative to the shear connections covered by the scope of Section I8.3, and the other based on a direct analytical implementation of performance

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_27.md -->

characteristics that either do not meet, or exceed those characteristic for the methods of shear connections currently stipulated by Section I8.3.

Aside from the relevant shear connection strength,  $ Q_{n} $ , the performance of the shear connection is further dictated by the presumptive values of slip capacity, composite beam or component reliability, geometric and material constraints of evaluated shear connection, and shear connection stiffness.

### 4 a. Test Standard

The Specification provisions relative to shear connection strength have traditionally been based on the body of data generated through push-out tests (Ollgaard et al., 1971; Lyons et al., 1994; Rodenberry et al., 2002a, 2002b). While no formal or codified test protocol had traditionally existed aside from Annex A of EN-1994-1-1 (CEN, 2009), the key elements of the procedure have remained relatively unchanged. Evaluation services, such as the International Code Council Evaluation Services (ICC-ES) and the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials Uniform Evaluation Services (IAPMO UES), have published evaluation criteria leading to the establishment of formal procedures for quantifying shear connection mechanical properties (IAPMO, 2015; IAPMO, 2018). The most typical implementation venue for these protocols involves a pursuit of an evaluation report, which serves as a basis of acceptance by the authority having jurisdiction.

To facilitate the development of its own composite design provisions, AISI has published AISI S923 (AISI, 2020a), a testing standard for the assessment of shear connection performance in composite steel-concrete members. This standard serves as the basis of evaluation using this provision of the Specification, though comparable alternatives, depending on their scope and provided their acceptability to the authority having jurisdiction, such as those aforementioned, could be employed. AISI also published a companion standard AISI S924 (AISI, 2020b) for the assessment of composite section stiffness, which can be employed in conjunction with any particular method of shear connection.

Other similar protocols are provided by EN1994-1-1 Annex A (CEN, 2009), IAPMO UES EC-023 (IAPMO, 2015), and EC-033 (IAPMO, 2018). AISI S923 is general in scope. The other protocols mentioned, while equivalent in application, are generally specific in terminology and configuration to specific types of shear connectors. The users, as an alternative, may for convenience choose to apply these other protocols instead of AISI S923.

### 4 b. Nominal and Available Strength

Nominal strength of the shear connection is necessary for the calculation of composite member connection strength. Available strength is used for the connection component strength. The coefficient of 0.85 represents an adjustment to account for the statistical bias factor (Mujagic and Easterling, 2009) relative to the strength computation model for headed shear studs developed by Rodenberry et al. (2002a, 2002b). The application of the bias factor adjustment, in addition to the acceptance criteria outlined in Section I8.4d, assures the usage of the strength reduction factors presently stipulated by this Specification. Alternatively, the bias factor can be

<!-- Source: aisc360-22-markdown/AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_28.md -->

removed and a separate strength reduction factor can be calculated using the data directly, in lieu of those provided by this Specification.

### 4 c. Shear Connection Slip Capacity

Starting with its 2016 edition, the Specification has explicitly required the consideration of shear connection ductility, also defined by the term slip capacity, in the assessment of composite beam available strength. The commentary provides additional guidelines on the methods for considering shear connection slip capacity. Many typical shear connection assemblies exhibit a nominally elastic-perfectly-plastic load-slip response, with a slightly descending response curve. The factor of 0.95, also commonly used in other similar contexts, provides for the consideration of capturing considerable and structurally useful slip capacity and an inconsequential loss of strength in a ductile assembly.

### 4 d. Acceptance Criteria

The conditions (1) through (3), in addition to the requirements of Sections I8.4a through I8.4c, aim at providing for the usage of alternative shear connection methods based on equivalency in performance to the methods currently recognized by Section I8.3.

Reliability assessment of composite beams, even in its simplest first-order second-moment formulation, is a complex effort, impractical to undertake on a case-by-case basis, greatly influenced by geometric parameters, mechanical properties of the components of a composite section, and the consequent position of the neutral axis in the section. When composite beams are partially composite, the coefficient of variation relative to the influence of shear connection on the composite beam strength becomes a function whose influence varies based on the degree of composite action, the governing failure mode, and other factors. The strength reduction factor currently stipulated by the Specification relative to the strength prediction model for the shear connection, when used for connection component design, or the strength reduction factor used in composite beams based on the model by Roddenberry et al. (2002a, 2002b) reflect an upper limit of 0.18 on the coefficient of variation relative to the influence of shear connection, along with a governing bias factor of 1.17, characteristic for solid slab configurations (Mujagic and Easterling, 2009). The original reliability analyses leading to the current strength reduction factor operated with a considerable data space. As assessment of the performance of individual connection configurations is typically based on a limited number of tests, the effect of the standard error of the mean could become pronounced. For this reason, two thresholds were provided scaling the coefficient of variation of 0.18 to 0.15 and 0.09 for the data space of nine and four replicate tests, respectively.

The Specification requirement to establish the effect of shear connection ductility still applies. The value of 0.25 in. (6 mm) represents the threshold ductility value for a  $ \frac{3}{4} $ -in.- (19-mm-) diameter steel headed stud anchor in a solid slab upon which the previous Specification editions have implicitly been based. Alternative methods of shear connection that meet this requirement are subject to the same commentary guidelines on ductility as provided for the conventional shear connection in Commentary Section I3.2d.

While elastic shear stiffness is traditionally related to serviceability considerations, the concern for an early departure from a typical load-slip relationship, despite the ductility ultimately achieved, could cause premature discontinuities in the composite section strain diagram and invalidate basic design and analysis assumptions. For this reason, the acceptance limit on minimum shear elastic stiffness has been imposed. While subject to the influence of variables, such as the modulus of elasticity of steel and the surrounding concrete, stud position relative to deck rib, etc., the value of 2,000 kip/in. (350 000 N/mm), determined as the slope of the load-slip line between the points of 10 and 40% of the ultimate load, is a typical upper-bound value seen in push-out tests (Lyons et al., 1994; Rodenberry et al., 2002a, 2002b) and predicted by the proposed analytical models (Oehlers and Coughlan, 1986; Xu and Liu, 2019).

Condition (4) allows the Specification user to circumvent the acceptance conditions (1) through (3) and the application of the bias factor of Section I8.4b by capturing the effects of different performance thresholds directly in the design, whether determining the available or required strength.
