Alignment chart. Nomograph for determining the effective length factor, K, for some types of columns.

Biaxial bending. Simultaneous bending of a member about two perpendicular axes.

Brittle fracture. Abrupt cleavage with little or no prior ductile deformation.

Column curve. Curve expressing the relationship between axial column strength and slenderness ratio.

Critical load. Load at which a perfectly straight member under compression may either assume a deflected position or may remain undeflected, or a beam under flexure may either deflect and twist out-of-plane or remain in its in-plane deflected position, as determined by a theoretical stability analysis.

Drift damage index. Parameter used to measure the potential damage caused by interstory drift.

Effective moment of inertia. Moment of inertia of the cross section of a member that remains elastic when partial plastification of the cross section takes place, usually under the combination of residual stress and applied stress; also, the moment of inertia based on effective widths of elements that buckle locally; also, the moment of inertia used in the design of partially composite members.

Effective stiffness. Stiffness of a member computed using the effective moment of inertia of its cross section.

Fatigue threshold. Stress range at which fatigue cracking will not initiate regardless of the number of cycles of loading.

First-order plastic analysis. Structural analysis based on the assumption of rigid-plastic behavior—in other words, that equilibrium is satisfied throughout the structure and the stress is at or below the yield stress—and in which equilibrium conditions are formulated on the undeformed structure.

Flexible connection. Connection permitting a portion, but not all, of the simple beam rotation of a member end.

Inelastic action. Material deformation that does not disappear on removal of the force that produced it.

Interstory drift. Lateral deflection of a floor relative to the lateral deflection of the floor immediately below, divided by the distance between floors,  $ (\delta_{n}-\delta_{n-1})/h $ .

# CHAPTER A GENERAL PROVISIONS

Chapter A includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Referenced specifications, codes, and standards have been updated to the most recent and applicable versions.

(2) ASTM F3148 bolts have been added as an acceptable bolt product.

(3) Section A3.1 has been revised to present the approved ASTM standards in Table A3.1, which lists the permissible strengths and grades and other limitations for the referenced ASTM standards.

(4) Section A4 has been expanded to include information from the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (AISC, 2022a) that is to be provided in the structural design documents. Clarification has been added regarding requirements for structural design documents issued for construction or issued for any purpose.

(5) Section A5, Approvals, has been added to include requirements for review and approval of documents by the engineer of record or registered design professional.

### A1. SCOPE

The scope of this Specification is essentially the same as the 2016 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2016) that it replaces.

The basic purpose of the provisions in this Specification is the determination of the nominal and available strengths of the members, connections, and other components of steel building structures.

This Specification provides two methods of design:

(a) Load and resistance factor design (LRFD): The nominal strength is multiplied by a resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , resulting in the design strength, which is then required to equal or exceed the required strength determined by structural analysis for the appropriate LRFD load combinations specified by the applicable building code.

(b) Allowable strength design (ASD): The nominal strength is divided by a safety factor,  $ \Omega $ , resulting in the allowable strength, which is then required to equal or exceed the required strength determined by structural analysis for the appropriate ASD load combinations specified by the applicable building code.

This Specification gives provisions for determining the values of the nominal strengths according to the applicable limit states and lists the corresponding values of the resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , and the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ . Nominal strength is usually defined in terms of resistance to a load effect, such as axial force, bending moment, shear, or torque, but in some instances it is expressed in terms of a stress. The ASD safety factors are calibrated to give the same structural reliability and the same component

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_3.md -->

size as the LRFD method at a live-to-dead load ratio of 3. The term “available strength” is used throughout the Specification to denote design strength and allowable strength, as applicable.

This Specification is applicable to both buildings and other structures. Many structures found in petrochemical plants, power plants, and other industrial applications are designed, fabricated, and erected in a manner similar to buildings. It is not intended that this Specification address steel structures with vertical and lateral force-resisting systems that are not similar to buildings, nor those constructed of shells or catenary cables.

The Specification may be used for the design of structural steel elements, as defined in the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (AISC, 2022a), hereafter referred to as the Code of Standard Practice, when used as components of nonbuilding structures or other structures. Engineering judgment must be applied to the Specification requirements when the structural steel elements are exposed to environmental or service conditions and loads not usually applicable to building structures.

The Code of Standard Practice defines the practices that are the commonly accepted standards of custom and usage for structural steel fabrication and erection. As such, the Code of Standard Practice is primarily intended to serve as a contractual document to be incorporated into the contract between the buyer and seller of fabricated structural steel. Some parts of the Code of Standard Practice, however, form the basis for some of the provisions in this Specification. Therefore, the Code of Standard Practice is referenced in selected locations in this Specification to maintain the ties between these documents, where appropriate.

The Specification disallows seismic design of buildings and other structures using the provisions of Appendix 1, Section 1.3. The R-factor specified in ASCE/SEI 7-22 (ASCE, 2022) used to determine the seismic loads is based on a nominal value of system overstrength and ductility that is inherent in steel structures designed by elastic analysis using this Specification. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take advantage of the additional strength afforded by the inelastic design approach presented in Appendix 1, Section 1.3, while simultaneously using the code specified R-factor. In addition, the provisions for ductility in Appendix 1, Section 1.3.2, are not fully consistent with the intended levels for seismic design.

In the Specification, which is used in general commercial applications, the quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) terms primarily refer to fabrication and erection procedures, qualifications, documents, and inspection, and they distinguish between responsibilities of the representatives of the owner and the authority having jurisdiction and the responsibilities of the steel contractor. In the AISC Specification for Safety-Related Steel Structures for Nuclear Facilities (AISC, 2018b), QA refers to evaluation of all parts of the process that have an effect on the final product, including structural analysis and design, as well as fabrication and erection, and QC refers to inspection and testing performed during the steel fabrication and erection process. The elements of QA in the nuclear industry are based on the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.

### A2. REFERENCED SPECIFICATIONS, CODES, AND STANDARDS

Section A2 provides references to documents cited in this Specification. The date of the referenced document found in this Specification is the intended date referenced in this Commentary unless specifically indicated otherwise. Note that not all grades of a particular material specification are necessarily approved for use according to this Specification. For a list of approved materials and grades, see Section A3.

### A3. MATERIAL

### 1. Structural Steel Materials

### 1 a. Listed Materials

There are hundreds of steel materials and products. This Specification lists those products/materials that are commonly useful to structural engineers and those that have a history of satisfactory performance as anticipated in the other provisions of the Specification. Other materials may be suitable for specific applications, but the evaluation of those materials is the responsibility of the engineer specifying them. In addition to typical strength properties, considerations for materials may include, but are not limited to, strength properties in transverse directions, ductility, formability, soundness, weldability including sensitivity to thermal cycles, notch toughness, and other forms of crack sensitivity, coatings, and corrosivity. Consideration for product form may include material considerations in addition to effects of production, tolerances, testing, reporting, and surface profiles.

Table A3.1 includes information concerning permitted grades and strengths and other limitations that are beyond what has historically been presented. ASTM A572/A572M Type 5 is not included due to potential problems associated with welding. HSS are limited to electric-resistance welding (ERW) or seamless to prohibit the use of furnace welding that may result in seams that do not achieve full strength of the base metal. Materials used in the production of ASTM A1065/A1065M are limited because other materials listed in ASTM A1065/A1065M do not have a history of satisfactory performance when used in buildings. Welding quenched and tempered steels such as ASTM A514/A514M can be challenging due to their higher strength and the need to control welding procedures more carefully. If proper procedures are not followed, high hardness in the heat affected zone is possible. This can lead to premature or even immediate failure. While this should not prohibit its use, the engineer should consult the steel producer if they choose to use the material. ASTM A709/A709M Grade 50CR (345CR) is a stainless steel and is not approved for use with the Specification.

Hot-Rolled Shapes. The commentary herein contains information relevant to hot-rolled shapes, as well as plates. Particularly, in segments of this commentary where the term "rolled steel" or "hot-rolled steel" is used, the information may be applicable to both shapes and plates. The grades of steel approved for use under this Specification, covered by ASTM Specifications, extend to a yield stress of 80 ksi (550 MPa) for rolled shapes and 100 ksi (690 MPa) for plates. Some of the ASTM Specifications specify a minimum yield point, while others specify a minimum yield strength. The term "yield stress" is used in this Specification as a generic term to denote either the yield point or the yield strength.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_5.md -->

It is important to be aware of limitations of availability that may exist for some combinations of strength and size. Not all structural section sizes are included in the various material specifications. For example, the 60 ksi (415 MPa) yield stress steel in ASTM A572/A572M includes plate only up to  $ 2\frac{1}{2} $  in. (63 mm) in thickness. Another limitation on availability is that even when a product is included in this Specification, it may be infrequently produced by the mills. Specifying these products may result in procurement delays or require ordering large quantities directly from the producing mills. Consequently, it is prudent to check availability before completing the details of a design. The AISC web site provides this information (www.aisc.org).

Properties in the direction of rolling are of principal interest in the design of steel structures. Hence, yield stress, as determined by the standard tensile test, is the principal mechanical property recognized in the selection of the steels approved for use under this Specification. It must be recognized that other mechanical and physical properties of rolled steel, such as anisotropy, ductility, notch toughness, formability, corrosion resistance, etc., may also be important to the satisfactory performance of a structure.

For rotary-straightened W-shapes, an area of reduced notch toughness has been documented in a limited region of the web immediately adjacent to the flange. Considerations in design and detailing that recognize this situation are presented in Chapter J.

It is not possible to incorporate in the Commentary adequate information to impart full understanding of all factors that might merit consideration in the selection and specification of materials for unique or especially demanding applications. In such a situation, the user of this Specification is advised to make use of reference material contained in the literature on the specific properties of concern and to specify supplementary material production or quality requirements as provided for in ASTM material specifications.

The following special cases should be considered:

Highly Restrained Welded Connections and Lamellar Tearing. Rolled steel is anisotropic, especially insofar as ductility is concerned; therefore, weld contraction strains in the region of highly restrained welded connections may exceed the strength of the material if special attention is not given to material selection, details, workmanship, and inspection (AISC, 1973).

Potential through-thickness structural problems of hot-rolled steel, including lamellar tearing and delamination, result from an interaction of several factors: connection design and detailing; fabrication and erection procedures; and base metal properties, including fracture toughness and ductility in the through-thickness direction. Highly restrained connections of any hot-rolled members may be susceptible, regardless of thickness, though this phenomenon is more likely with material that exceeds  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm). See “Through Thickness Properties of Structural Steels” (Barsom and Korvink, 1997) for a complete discussion of the material considerations. As early in the project as possible, the engineer should consult the steel producer regarding if and where improved and consistent through-thickness properties are required.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_6.md -->

steel producer can supply steel with improved through-thickness properties by implementing additional metallurgical or heat treatment processing.

The geometry of the welded connections should be designed to avoid through-thickness tensile stresses and configure the joint to best limit restraint and reduce weld metal volume. See recommendations in AWS D1.1/D1.1M Commentary C-4.7.3 (AWS, 2020) and “Commentary on Highly Restrained Welded Connections” (AISC, 1973).

Other measures the engineer can specify to mitigate through-thickness challenges are listed below:

(1) Expand use of ultrasonic testing (UT) to inspect the steel at the location of the weld and surrounding area before and after welding. AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2022c) Section J7.2c requires the UT of base metal thicker than 1½ in. (38 mm) after joint (weld) completion behind and adjacent to the fusion line, and refers to AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020), Table 8.2, for acceptance criteria.

(2) Specify nondestructive examination (NDE) during the fabrication process. Visual examination, liquid penetrant, and magnetic particle testing can be used to identify surface discontinuities. UT can be used to detect internal discontinuities. Plate can be mill ordered with supplementary requirement S8, "Ultrasonic Examination," of ASTM A6/A6M, specifically ASTM A435/A435M (ASTM, 2017b) and ASTM A578/A578M (ASTM, 2017c). Radiography is not recommended because the relevant orientation of the discontinuities of interest are difficult to detect with this method. Results of NDE will enable the fabricator to locate steel members such that particularly susceptible material is not subjected to excessive through-thickness strains.

(3) Specify through-thickness tensile testing. For steel plates this is achieved in accordance with ASTM A770/A770M (ASTM, 2018b). This test evaluates susceptibility to lamellar tearing, where a minimum area reduction value of 20% has generally been shown to provide adequate ductility to help mitigate the problem, though a minimum value of 15% may be acceptable. CEN (2005c) gives a procedure for specifying area reductions of 15% and greater.

Including any of these measures should be carefully considered with input from the contractor and steel supplier regarding the cost, ease of implementation, and relative effectiveness.

Fracture Control Design for Service Conditions. For especially demanding service conditions, such as structures exposed to low temperatures, particularly those with cyclic or impact loading, the specification of steels with superior notch toughness may be warranted. However, for most buildings, the steel is relatively warm, strain rates are essentially static, and the stress intensity and number of cycles of full design stress are low. Accordingly, the probability of fracture in most building structures is low. Good workmanship and good design details incorporating joint geometry that avoids severe stress concentrations are generally the most effective means of providing fracture-resistant construction (AASHTO, 2014).

The Charpy V-notch (CVN) test allows for the measurement of the amount of energy absorbed during the fracture of standardized test specimens at a given temperature. The absorbed energy is the measure of the material's notch toughness. The CVN testing temperature can be significantly different from the material's service temperature to account for the difference in strain rate between the Charpy impact test (on the order of  $ 10\ sec^{-1}in./in. $ ) and the designed strain rate of the structure (typically  $ 10^{-3}\ sec^{-1}in./in. $  for static, wind, and seismic loadings) (Barsom and Rolfe, 1999).

Shapes produced with no minimum specified CVN requirements will generally provide some level of toughness, although no minimum values are guaranteed. In applications where increased fracture resistance is required, specified minimum CVN properties may offer improved reliability. For structures that are exposed to temperatures below  $ -30^{\circ}F $  ( $ -34^{\circ}C $ ), contract documents should specify steel that meets the minimum average absorbed energy recommended in Table C-A3.1 for main members that are statically loaded and subjected to bending or tension.

Plates. Portions of the Commentary for hot-rolled shapes are also applicable for plates.

Hollow Structural Sections (HSS). Specified minimum tensile properties are summarized in Table C-A3.2 for various HSS material specifications and grades. ASTM A53/A53M Grade B is a pipe specification included as an approved HSS material specification because it is the most readily available round product in the United States. Other North American HSS products that have properties and characteristics that are similar to the approved ASTM products are produced in Canada under the General Requirements for Rolled or Welded Structural Quality Steel (CSA, 2013). In addition, pipe is produced to other specifications that meet the strength, ductility, and weldability requirements of the materials in Section A3, but may have additional requirements for notch toughness or pressure testing. As stated in Section A3.1b,

materials not specifically listed in Table A3.1 are permitted when suitability is determined by the engineer of record (EOR).

Round HSS can be readily obtained in ASTM A53/A53M material and ASTM A500/A500M Grade C is also common. For rectangular HSS, ASTM A500/A500M Grade C is the most commonly available material and a special order would be required for any other material. Depending upon size, either welded or seamless round HSS can be obtained. In North America, however, all ASTM A500/A500M rectangular HSS for structural purposes are welded. Rectangular HSS differ from box sections in that they have uniform thickness, except for some thickening in the rounded corners.

Nominal strengths of directly welded T-, Y-, and K-connections of HSS have been developed analytically and empirically. Connection deformation is anticipated and is an acceptance limit for connection tests. Ductility is necessary to achieve the expected deformations. The ratio of the specified minimum yield strength to the specified minimum tensile strength (yield/tensile ratio) is one measure of material ductility. Materials in HSS used in connection tests have had a yield/tensile ratio of up to 0.80 and therefore that ratio has been adopted as a limit of applicability for directly welded HSS connections. ASTM A500/A500M Grade A material does not meet this ductility “limit of applicability” for direct connections in Chapter K. ASTM A500/A500M Grade C has a yield/tensile ratio of 0.807 but it is reasonable to use the rounding method described in ASTM E29 (ASTM, 2019c) and find this material acceptable for use.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_9.md -->

Even though ASTM A501/A501M includes rectangular HSS, hot-formed rectangular HSS are not currently produced in the United States. The General Requirements for Rolled or Welded Structural Quality Steel (CSA, 2013) includes Class C (cold-formed) and Class H (cold-formed and stress relieved) HSS. Class H HSS have relatively low levels of residual stress, which enhances their performance in compression and may provide better ductility in the corners of rectangular HSS.

API 5L (API, 2012) is a line pipe specification that has some requirements for mechanical characteristics that make it advantageous for use in specific structural applications, such as in long span roofs with long unbraced lengths or large composite columns in heavy unbraced frames. Note, however, that Section A3.1b states, for materials not specifically listed in Table A3.1, suitability must be determined by the EOR. The specified minimum yield strength of API 5L ranges from 25 to 80 ksi (170 to 550 MPa) and the specified minimum tensile strength ranges from 45 to 90 ksi (310 to 620 MPa), depending on product specification level and material grade. For Grades X42 and higher, additional elements may be used upon agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer; however, care should be exercised in determining the alloying content for any given size and wall thickness of pipe, because the addition of such otherwise desirable elements may affect the weldability of the pipe. PSL2 pipe is a common structural choice and Grade X52 is probably the most common grade for structural purposes. Some pertinent mechanical and geometric properties for PSL2 X52N are  $ F_{y}=52\ \text{ksi}\ (360\ \text{MPa}); F_{u}=66\ \text{ksi}\ (460\ \text{MPa}); $  toughness = 20 ft-lbf @ 32°F (27 J @ 0°C) for  $ D \leq 30\ \text{in.}\ (750\ \text{mm}) $ ; a wall thickness lower tolerance of -10% for  $ \frac{3}{16}\ \text{in.}\ < t < \frac{19}{32}\ \text{in.}\ (5\ \text{mm} < t < 15\ \text{mm}) $ , and -0.02 in. (-0.5 mm) for  $ t < \frac{3}{16}\ \text{in.}\ (t < 5\ \text{mm}) $ ; and a mass or area tolerance of -3.5% for regular plain-ended pipe. With a diameter range from  $ \frac{13}{32}\ \text{in.} $  to 84 in. (10 mm to 2100 mm), this high-quality pipe material addresses a frequent need for either large diameter or thick-walled round hollow sections. Other special features of PSL2 pipe are an upper bound on the yield strength [for example, for X52 the minimum and maximum yield strengths are 52 ksi (360 MPa) and 76 ksi (520 MPa), respectively], and a maximum yield-to-tensile stress ratio of 0.93 in the as-delivered pipe [for D > 12.75 in. (319 mm)].

### 1 d. Rolled Heavy Shapes

The web-to-flange intersection and the web center of heavy hot-rolled shapes, as well as the interior portions of heavy plates, may contain a more coarse grain structure and/or lower notch toughness material than other areas of these products (Cattan, 1995; Jaquess and Frank, 1999). This is probably caused by ingot segregation, the somewhat lesser deformation during hot rolling, higher finishing temperature, and the slower cooling rate after rolling for these heavy sections. This characteristic is not detrimental to suitability for compression members or for nonwelded members. However, when heavy cross sections are joined by splices or connections using complete-joint-penetration groove welds that extend through the coarser and/or lower notch-tough interior portions, tensile stresses induced by weld shrinkage may result in cracking. An example is a complete-joint-penetration groove welded connection of a heavy cross-section beam to any column section. When members of lesser thickness are joined by complete-joint-penetration groove welds, which induce smaller

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_10.md -->

weld shrinkage strains, to the finer grained and/or more notch-tough surface material of ASTM A6/A6M shapes and heavy built-up cross sections, the potential for cracking is significantly lower. An example is a complete-joint-penetration groove welded connection of a nonheavy cross-section beam to a heavy cross-section column.

For critical applications, such as primary tension members, material should be specified to provide adequate notch toughness at service temperatures. Because of differences in the strain rate between the Charpy V-notch (CVN) impact test and the strain rate experienced in actual structures, the CVN test is conducted at a temperature higher than the anticipated service temperature for the structure. The location of the CVN test specimens (“alternate core location”) is specified in ASTM A6/A6M, Supplemental Requirement S30.

The notch toughness requirements of Sections A3.1d and A3.1e are intended only to provide structural steel material with a nominal yield strength of 50 ksi with reasonable notch toughness for ordinary service applications [enclosed structures or lowest anticipated service temperature of  $ 50^{\circ} $ F ( $ 10^{\circ} $ C) or higher]. For unusual applications, low temperature service, and/or higher strength material, more restrictive requirements and/or notch toughness requirements for other section sizes and thicknesses may be appropriate (Barsom and Rolfe, 1999). To minimize the potential for fracture, the notch toughness requirements of Sections A3.1d and A3.1e must be used in conjunction with good design and fabrication procedures. Specific requirements are given in Sections J1.5, J1.6, J2.6, and J2.7.

### 1 e. Built-Up Heavy Shapes

Portions of Commentary Section A3.1d for rolled heavy shapes are also applicable for built-up heavy shapes.

### 2. Steel Castings and Forgings

Design and fabrication of cast and forged steel components are not covered in this Specification.

Steel Castings. There are a number of ASTM Specifications for steel castings. The Steel Founders' Society of America (SFSA) Steel Castings Handbook (SFSA, 1995) discusses a number of standards useful for steel structures. In addition to the requirements of this Specification, SFSA recommends that various other requirements be considered for cast steel products. Continued quality assurance is critical to make certain there is confidence in the cast product. This includes testing of first article components as well as production testing. It may be appropriate to inspect the first piece cast using magnetic particle inspection (MPI) in accordance with ASTM E125, degree 1a, b, or c (ASTM, 2013). Radiographic inspection level III may be desirable for the first piece cast. Ultrasonic testing (UT) in compliance with ASTM A609/A609M (ASTM, 2012a) may be appropriate for the first cast piece over 6 in. (150 mm) thick. UT and MPI of production castings are also advisable. Design approval, sample approval, periodic nondestructive testing, chemical testing, and selection of the correct welding specification should be among the issues defined in the selection and procurement of cast steel products. Refer to SFSA (1995) for design information about cast steel products. For visual examination, refer to ASTM A802 (ASTM,

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_11.md -->

(2015a); for magnetic particle and liquid penetrant surface and subsurface examination, refer to ASTM A903/A903M (ASTM, 2012b); for radiographic examination, refer to ASTM E1030/E1030M (ASTM, 2015b); and for ultrasonic examination, refer to ASTM A609/A609M (ASTM, 2012a). ASTM A958/A958M (ASTM, 2021b) is a cast steel used in the Kaiser Bolted Bracket Moment Connection, a prequalified moment connection in ANSI/AISC 358 (AISC, 2022b), but it may also be specified in some nonseismic applications. Additional information about cast steels can be found in the Steel Castings Handbook, Supplement 2 (SFSA, 2009).

Steel Forgings. There are a number of ASTM specifications for steel forgings. The Forging Industry Association's Forging Industry Handbook (FIA, 1985) discusses some typical forging issues, but more detailed information can be obtained at www.forging.org. Steel forgings should conform to ASTM A668/A668M (ASTM, 2021a) and the related ASTM testing requirements. UT should be in compliance with ASTM A388/A388M (ASTM, 2019b) and MPI in accordance with ASTM A275/A275M (ASTM, 2018a). Many of the frequently used structural forgings are catalog items for which the testing has been established. For custom forgings, the frequency and type of testing required should be established to conform to ASTM requirements.

### 3. Bolts, Washers, and Nuts

ASTM F3125/F3125M is an umbrella specification, first referenced in the 2016 AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2016), that covers fasteners that were previously referred to as ASTM A325/A325M, ASTM A490/A490M, ASTM F1852, and ASTM F2280 fasteners. These previously separate standards have been unified, coordinated, and made consistent with each other, turning them into Grades of ASTM F3125/F3125M. From the user perspective, not much has changed, as the head marks remain the same, and handling and installation remain the same. Nevertheless, the specifier should be aware that ASTM F3125/F3125M now contains Grades A325, A325M, A490, A490M, F1852, and F2280 fasteners. One change of note is that under ASTM F3125/F3125M, Grades A325 and A325M fasteners are uniformly 120 ksi (830 MPa); Grades A325 and A325M had a drop in strength to 105 ksi (725 MPa) for diameters over 1 in. (25 mm) in previous standards.

The ASTM standard specification for ASTM A307 bolts covers two grades of fasteners. Either grade may be used under this Specification; however, it should be noted that Grade B is intended for pipe-flange bolting and Grade A is the grade long in use for structural applications.

### 4. Anchor Rods and Threaded Rods

ASTM F1554 is the primary specification for anchor rods. Because there is a limit on the maximum available length of structural bolts, the attempt to use these bolts for anchor rods with design lengths longer than the maximum available lengths has presented problems in the past. The inclusion of ASTM A449 and ASTM A354 materials in this Specification allows the use of higher strength material for bolts longer than structural bolts.

The EOR should specify the required strength for threaded rods used as load-carrying members.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_12.md -->

### 5. Consumables for Welding

The AWS filler metal specifications listed in Section A3.5 are general specifications that include filler metal classifications suitable for building construction, as well as classifications that may not be suitable for building construction. AWS D1.1/D1.1M, Structural Welding Code—Steel (AWS, 2020) Table 5.4 lists the various filler metals that may be used for prequalified welding procedure specifications, for the various steels that are to be joined. This list specifically does not include various classifications of filler metals that are not suitable for structural steel applications. Filler metals listed under the various AWS A5 filler metal specifications may or may not have specified notch toughness properties, depending on the specific electrode classification. Section J2.6 identifies certain welded joints where notch toughness of filler metal is needed in building construction. There may be other situations where the EOR may elect to specify the use of filler metals with specified notch toughness properties, such as for structures subjected to high loading rate, cyclic loading, or seismic loading. Because AWS D1.1/D1.1M does not automatically require that the filler metal used have specified notch toughness properties, it is important that filler metals used for such applications be of an AWS classification, where such properties are required. This information can be found in the various AWS filler metal specifications and is often contained on the filler metal manufacturer's certificate of conformance or product specification sheets.

When specifying filler metal and/or flux by AWS designation, the applicable standard specifications should be carefully reviewed to assure a complete understanding of the designation reference. This is necessary because the AWS designation systems are not consistent. For example, in the case of electrodes for shielded metal arc welding, AWS A5.1/A5.1M, the first two or three digits indicate the nominal tensile strength classification, in ksi, of the filler metal and the final two digits indicate the type of coating. For metric designations, the first two digits times 10 indicate the nominal tensile strength classification in MPa. In the case of mild steel electrodes for submerged arc welding, AWS A5.17/A5.17M, the first one or two digits times 10 indicate the nominal tensile strength classification for both U.S. customary and metric units, while the final digit or digits times 10 indicate the testing temperature in  $ {}^{\circ} $ F for filler metal impact tests. In the case of low-alloy steel covered arc welding electrodes, AWS A5.5/A5.5M, certain portions of the designation indicate a requirement for stress relief, while others indicate no stress relief requirement.

Engineers do not, in general, specify the exact filler metal to be employed on a particular structure. Rather, the decision as to which welding process and which filler metal is to be utilized is usually left with the fabricator or erector. Codes restrict the usage of certain filler metals or impose qualification testing to prove the suitability of the specific electrode, so as to make certain that the proper filler metals are used.

### A4. STRUCTURAL DESIGN DOCUMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS

### 1. Structural Design Documents and Specifications Issued for Construction

This Specification provides minimum requirements that are deemed effective to provide satisfactory results in steel buildings and other structures within the intended

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_13.md -->

scope of the Specification. It is not intended or necessary to list all the requirements stated in the Specification for listing in the design documents and specifications issued for construction. The items specified in this section are deemed to be important for specific mention and to be listed. When modified or additional requirements are warranted for a particular project, these should be considered by the designer and direct references to the Specification should be employed where appropriate.

The information specified to be shown on design documents issued for construction is considered important for ensuring that all applicable elements of the structural steel frame, including connections, are documented and addressed by the engineer of record (EOR) as required by the Specification. The 2021 International Building Code (IBC) (ICC, 2021) requires that a registered design professional in responsible charge be assigned the role of reviewing and coordinating submittal documents prepared by others, including phased and deferred submittals as defined in Chapter 1 of the IBC. Some design information required for final construction as listed in Section A4 may be contained in deferred submittals prepared by a specialty structural engineer, if approved by the authority having jurisdiction. This practice may be used for metal buildings and for joists and joist girders. The authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) is the final authority dictating requirements for design documents issued for permit and for final construction. Refer to the 2021 IBC and CASE Document 962-B (CASE, 1996) for further information.

For projects that use a design-build delivery method, where the EOR or internal design engineer, as applicable, is employed by the fabricator or incorporate deferred submittals, such as buckling-restrained braces, custom fabricated trusses, or steel connections, some information specified in Section A4 is transmitted between the designer and fabricator internally and there may be no need to issue documents from one entity to the other in order for construction to commence. However, the intent of Section A4 is to document the information between parties. Section A4 anticipates that this documentation would be in the form of structural design documents and specifications as specified, although it is recognized that other means of documenting the required information are possible.

When the AHJ, applicable building code, purchaser, owner, or EOR judge that supplemental life safety requirements are advisable, such requirements should be indicated in the documents that are released for construction. Such requirements might include, for example, material testing, reporting and traceability, additional quality control and nondestructive testing, specific erection requirements, or other important items critical to life safety.

In reference to item (k), preset elevation requirements at free ends of cantilevered members relative to their fixed-end elevations, it may be necessary to specify a relative elevation to which the free end of a cantilever must be erected (preset) prior to load application, with the fixed end stabilized before the member is released from the crane or temporary support and any other load is applied to it. This is needed so that the cantilevered member can be detailed and fabricated to allow for any required preset. This does not apply to a beam that is continuous over a support, which is controlled by camber, not preset.

Design of Structural Steel Connections. It is recognized that various means of designating and designing structural steel connections have been used in structural steel construction. Therefore, it is important to address these means in this Commentary. The Code of Standard Practice (AISC, 2022a) describes three options that can be used. One of these options should be indicated for each connection in a project. It is acceptable to group connection types and utilize a combination of these options for the various connection types involved in a project.

When the EOR intends to provide complete connection design in the structural design documents (described as Option 1 in the Code of Standard Practice), the design drawings should include the following:

(a) All weld types, sizes, lengths, and electrode specification tensile strengths

(b) All bolt sizes, locations, quantities, and grades

(c) All plate and angle sizes, thicknesses, dimensions, and grades

(d) All work point locations and related information

Welds should be specified as required by AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020). This includes the following:

(1) The effective weld length and required effective throat for partial-joint-penetration groove welds.

(2) The effective weld length and leg size for fillet welds.

(3) When the strength of the connected element must be developed, a weld symbol without a dimension and without CJP in its tail designates a weld that will develop the adjacent base metal strength in tension and shear.

(4) Any special end return requirements.

If standard welding symbols are insufficient to convey the design intent, special conditions should be fully explained by added notes or details.

When other methods are used, the EOR must provide data concerning the loads, including shears, moments, axial forces, and transfer forces, that are to be resisted by the individual members and their connections, sufficient to allow the selection, completion, or design of the connection details.

In some cases, connection design is dependent on multiple load combinations in the members, and these member loads must be provided. Specific examples include the following:

•  $ P_{r} $ , the required axial strength, necessary to determine the web panel-zone shear strength in Section J10.6

• The required axial and flexural strengths in a hollow structural section (HSS) chord at a joint necessary to determine strength relative to many limit states in Section J10 and Chapter K

When the EOR intends to allow an experienced steel detailer to select or complete the structural steel connections (described as Option 2 in the Code of Standard Practice), the EOR is the only engineer involved in the process. The experienced steel detailer is not expected to perform engineering calculations.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_15.md -->

When structural steel connection design is delegated to be designed by a licensed engineer (described as Option 3 in the Code of Standard Practice), the EOR must provide project-specific schematic connection details based on realistic design forces to define the design intent and sufficient information, provided in writing, for the delegated connection designer (the licensed engineer to whom the work is delegated) to understand the scope and nature of the delegated work and its relationship to the overall design. The information that is required to perform the delegated design shall be commensurate with the nature and complexity of the project. It may include not only member loads, but also references to technical articles, journals, and other performance standards; or other relevant and related information, as appropriate, to understand the design intent and perform the required calculations.

Delegated structural steel connection design does not serve as a peer review of the EOR’s design documents.

The EOR must review and approve the substantiating connection information and the resulting shop drawings, or other documents that are submitted, for conformance with the specified criteria and compatibility with the design intent. The EOR is the final authority and responsible party for the connections utilized on the project.

Design of Member Reinforcement. Ideally, members should be sized for local effects at locations of structural steel connections such that local reinforcement is not required. If members are not sized for local effects at locations of structural steel connections, member reinforcement may be required to satisfy strength and equilibrium of forces through the connection. Such local member reinforcement may include column stiffeners, web doubler plates, beam bearing stiffeners, HSS joint cans, external chord stiffeners, and all other forms of reinforcement. Methods for designing and fabricating such reinforcing are well-established and addressed in this Specification for some cases. For other cases, such as for connections involving HSS, methods for designing and fabricating reinforcing are not addressed and can be complex. In any case, such local reinforcement (or when structural steel connection design is delegated, the potential need for such local reinforcement) is addressed in the Code of Standard Practice and must be identified in the design documents.

### 2. Structural Design Documents and Specifications Issued for Any Purpose

Structural design documents are commonly issued for various purposes on a structural steel project. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, issued for construction, for permit, for fabrication and erection (for example, commencing work on the project by the fabricator and erector, ordering structural steel, and commencing work on shop drawings, etc.), or for all or a portion of the project as specified. They can also be issued for preliminary or intermediate budget pricing, an initial or final guaranteed maximum price (IGMP or GMP), for bidding, and for contract documents, as defined in the Code of Standard Practice. The intent of this section of the Specification is that the EOR and the various project stakeholders fully communicate and have a common understanding of the purpose for which the documents are being issued and that such documents be clearly labeled for that purpose and dated. It is anticipated that the purpose and date would be applied in the title block of each drawing that is issued, which has been customary in past and current practice on many projects. If

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_16.md -->

the releasing entity (for example, owner, general contractor, construction manager, or other party) releases the documents for bidding, negotiating for, or executing a contract, this Specification requires that documents released be so labeled by the EOR for such purpose. The EOR is the only party that fully understands and can interpret the design status and whether sufficient information is shown on the documents for the purpose of bidding or contract. Release of documents for bidding or contract that are not sufficiently complete could have life safety implications if the structural design is not advanced to allow proper definition of the scope of work. The issuance of design documents and specifications for construction by the EOR and the requirements listed under Section A4.1 are deemed to protect life safety and public welfare. It is recommended that structural design documents issued for permit, ordering structural steel, or placing a mill order also meet the stated requirements for documents issued for construction. Issuance of structural design documents for these purposes, when the documents are partially complete and the design is evolving, requires good communication among the parties and careful coordination of handling items that are not yet designed and shown on the design documents. While ideally all design information should be provided at the start of construction, this is not always practical or possible with an accelerated design schedule. The safety of the structure mandates that the requirements for design documents in this section be satisfied before construction on the specified portion of the structure is initiated. Revisions to design documents may require adjustments to the contract price and schedule. However, such contractual matters are beyond the scope of the Specification and are addressed in the Code of Standard Practice. Refer to the Code of Standard Practice Section 3.2 for requirements when issuing structural design documents and specifications that serve as the basis for contract documents as defined therein.

### A5. APPROVALS

Code of Standard Practice (AISC, 2022a) Section 4.4 addresses the approval process. Engineers do not commonly construct buildings; instead, they produce design documents and specifications to inform the construction process. The review and approval of the approval documents is a vital part of the construction process and is a confirmation that the engineer of record's (EOR) design intent has been correctly interpreted; it is an important part of the design and construction process, the ultimate goal of which is the safety of the structure, and, therefore, is now addressed in this Specification.

CASE Document 962-D (CASE, 2020) indicates that when the design of some element of the primary structural system is delegated to someone other than the structural EOR, “…such elements, including connections designed by others, should be reviewed by the structural engineer of record or other responsible engineer. He [or she] should review such designs and details, accept or reject them and be responsible for their effects on the primary structural system.” Historically, the Code of Standard Practice has embraced this same concept.

Submittal documents as prepared by a specialty structural engineer and approved by the EOR or registered design professional in responsible charge is commonly accepted practice with manufacturers of metal buildings, proprietary seismic components, and steel joist manufacturers, provided it is approved by the authority having jurisdiction. Refer to the 2021 IBC Chapter 1, Section 107 (ICC, 2021), for additional information.

# CHAPTER B DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Chapter B includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) The approximate method for inelastic moment redistribution (often referred to as the nine-tenths rule) has been relocated to Appendix 8.

(2) Clarification is provided for use of partially restrained (PR) moment connections by expanding the requirements.

(3) Design for ponding provisions have been expanded, given that Appendix 2, Ponding, has been removed from the Specification.

(4) Section B4.1 has clarified the requirement that webs and flanges be continuously attached.

(5) Section B4.3 has clarified that the holes being considered are bolt holes.

(6) Section B8, Dimensional Tolerances, has been added to clarify that the provisions of the Specification are based on tolerances provided in the Code of Standard Practice and referenced ASTM standards.

### B1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

This Specification is meant to be primarily applicable to the common types of building frames with gravity loads carried by beams and girders and lateral loads carried by moment frames, braced frames, or shear walls. However, there are many unusual buildings or building-like structures for which this Specification is also applicable. Rather than attempt to establish the purview of the Specification with an exhaustive classification of construction types, Section B1 requires that the design of members and their connections be consistent with the intended use of the structure and the assumptions made in the analysis of the structure.

Section B1 widens the purview of this Specification to a class of construction types broader than those addressed in editions of the Specification prior to 2016. Section B1 recognizes that a structural system is a combination of members connected in such a way that the structure can respond in different ways to meet different design objectives under different loads. Even within the purview of ordinary buildings, there can be enormous variety in the design details.

Previous to the 2005 edition, the Specification contained a section titled "Types of Construction"; for example, Section A2 in the 1999 Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2000b). In this Specification, there is no such section and the requirements related to "types of construction" have been divided between Section B1, Section B3.4, and Section J1.

### B2. LOADS AND LOAD COMBINATIONS

The loads, load combinations, and nominal loads for use with this Specification are given in the applicable building code. In the absence of an applicable specific local, regional, or national building code, the loads (for example, D, L,  $ L_{r} $ , S, R, W, and E), load factors, load combinations, and nominal loads (numeric values for D, L, and other loads) are as specified in ASCE/SEI 7, Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE, 2022). The 2022 edition of ASCE/SEI 7 has adopted many of the seismic design provisions of the NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures (FEMA, 2020), as have the AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2022c). The reader is referred to the commentaries of these documents for an expanded discussion on loads, load factors, and seismic design.

This Specification is based on strength limit states that apply to structural steel design in general. The Specification permits design for strength using either load and resistance factor design (LRFD) or allowable strength design (ASD). It should be noted that the terms "strength" and "stress" reflect whether the appropriate section property has been applied in the calculation of the available strength. In most instances, the Specification uses "strength" rather than "stress." In all cases, it is a simple matter to recast the provisions into a stress format. The terminology used to describe load combinations in ASCE/SEI 7 is somewhat different from that used by this Specification. ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.3, defines Combining Factored Loads Using Strength Design; these combinations are applicable to design using the LRFD approach. ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.4, defines Combining Nominal Loads Using Allowable Stress Design; these combinations are applicable to design using the ASD approach.

LRFD Load Combinations. If the LRFD approach is selected, the load combination requirements are defined in ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.3.

The load combinations in ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.3, are based on modern probabilistic load modeling and a comprehensive survey of reliabilities inherent in traditional design practice (Galambos et al., 1982; Ellingwood et al., 1980; Ellingwood et al., 1982). These load combinations utilize a “principal action-companion action format,” which is based on the notion that the maximum combined load effect occurs when one of the time-varying loads takes on its maximum lifetime value (principal action) while the other variable loads are at “arbitrary point-in-time” values (companion actions), the latter being loads that would be measured in a load survey at any arbitrary time. The dead load, which is considered to be permanent, is the same for all combinations in which the load effects are additive. Research has shown that this approach to load combination analysis is consistent with the manner in which loads actually combine on structural elements and systems in situations in which strength limit states may be approached. The load factors reflect uncertainty in individual load magnitudes and in the analysis that transforms load to load effect. The nominal loads in ASCE/SEI 7 are substantially in excess of the arbitrary point-in-time values. The basis for the LRFD load combinations can be found in the Commentary to ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.3.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_19.md -->

The return period associated with earthquake loads was revised in both the 2003 and 2009 editions of the NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures (FEMA, 2003, 2009). In the 2009 edition, adopted as the basis for ASCE/SEI 7-10 (ASCE, 2010), the earthquake loads at most locations were intended to produce a collapse probability of 1% in a 50 year period, a performance objective that is achieved by requiring that the probability of incipient collapse, given the occurrence of the maximum considered earthquake (MCE), is less than 10%. This continues to be the basis of the current version of ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022). At some sites in regions of high seismic activity, where high intensity events occur frequently, deterministic limits on the ground motion result in somewhat higher collapse probabilities. The ASCE/SEI 7, Chapter 1 Commentary, provides information on the intended maximum probability of structural failure under earthquake and other loads.

Load combinations of ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.3, which apply specifically to cases in which the structural actions due to lateral forces and gravity loads counteract one another and the dead load stabilizes the structure, incorporate a load factor on dead load of 0.9.

ASD Load Combinations. If the ASD approach is selected, the load combination requirements are defined in ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.4.

The load combinations in ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.4, are similar to those traditionally used in allowable stress design. In ASD, safety is provided by the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ , and the nominal loads in the basic combinations involving gravity loads, earth pressure, or fluid pressure are not factored. The reduction in the combined time-varying load effect in combinations incorporating wind or earthquake load is achieved by the load combination factor 0.75. This load combination factor dates back to the 1972 edition of ANSI Standard A58.1 (ANSI, 1972), the predecessor of ASCE/SEI 7. It should be noted that in ASCE/SEI 7, the 0.75 factor applies only to combinations of variable loads; it is irrational to reduce the dead load because it is always present and does not fluctuate with time. It should also be noted that certain ASD load combinations may actually result in a higher required strength than similar load combinations for LRFD. Load combinations that apply specifically to cases in which the structural actions due to lateral forces and gravity loads counteract one another, where the dead load stabilizes the structure, incorporate a load factor on dead load of 0.6. This eliminates a deficiency in the traditional treatment of counteracting loads in ASD and emphasizes the importance of checking stability. The earthquake load effect is multiplied by 0.7 in applicable combinations involving that load to align ASD for earthquake effects with the definition of E in the sections of ASCE/SEI 7 defining seismic load effects and combinations.

The load combinations in ASCE/SEI 7, Sections 2.3 and 2.4, apply to design for strength limit states. They do not account for gross error or negligence. Loads and load combinations for nonbuilding structures and other structures may be defined in ASCE/SEI 7 or other applicable industry standards and practices.

### B3. DESIGN BASIS

As stated in this Specification: "design shall be such that no applicable strength or serviceability limit state shall be exceeded when the structure is subjected to all applicable load combinations." A limit state is a condition in which a structural system or component becomes unfit for its intended purpose (serviceability limit state) or has reached its ultimate load-carrying capacity (strength limit state). Limit states may be dictated by functional requirements, such as maximum deflections or drift; they may be related to structural behavior, such as the formation of a plastic hinge or mechanism; or they may represent the collapse of the whole or part of the structure, such as by instability or rupture. The design provisions in this Specification are established so that the probability of exceeding a limit state is acceptably small by stipulating the combination of load factors, resistance or safety factors, nominal loads, and nominal strengths consistent with the design assumptions.

Two kinds of limit states apply to structures: (a) strength limit states, which define safety against local or overall failure conditions during the intended life of the structure; and (b) serviceability limit states, which define functional requirements. This Specification, like other structural design codes, focuses primarily on strength limit states because of overriding considerations of public safety. This does not mean that limit states of serviceability (see Chapter L) are not important to the designer, who must provide for functional performance and economy of design. However, serviceability considerations permit more exercise of judgment on the part of the designer.

Load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and allowable strength design (ASD) are distinct methods for satisfying strength limit states. They are equally acceptable by this Specification, but their provisions are not interchangeable. Indiscriminate use of combinations of the two methods could result in unpredictable performance or unsafe design. Thus, the LRFD and ASD methods are specified as alternatives. There are, however, circumstances in which the two methods could be used in the design, modification, or renovation of a structural system without conflict, such as providing modifications to a structural floor system of an older building after assessing the as-built conditions.

Strength limit states vary from element to element, and several limit states may apply to a given element. The most common strength limit states are yielding, buckling, and rupture. The most common serviceability limit states include deflections or drift, and vibrations.

### 1. Design for Strength Using Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD)

Design for strength by LRFD is performed in accordance with Equation B3-1. The left side of Equation B3-1,  $ R_{u} $ , represents the required strength computed by structural analysis based on load combinations stipulated in ASCE/SEI 7, Section 2.3 (or their equivalent) (ASCE, 2022), while the right side,  $ \phi R_{n} $ , represents the limiting structural resistance, or design strength, provided by the member or element.

The resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , in this Specification is equal to or less than 1.00. When compared to the nominal strength,  $ R_{n} $ , computed according to the methods given in Chapters D through K, a  $ \phi $  of less than 1.00 accounts for approximations in the theory.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_21.md -->

and variations in mechanical properties and dimensions of members and frames. For limit states where  $ \phi = 1.00 $ , the nominal strength is judged to be sufficiently conservative when compared to the actual strength that no reduction is needed.

The LRFD provisions are based on (1) probabilistic models of loads and resistance, (2) a calibration of the LRFD provisions to the 1978 edition of the ASD Specification for selected members (AISC, 1978), and (3) the evaluation of the resulting provisions by judgment and past experience aided by comparative design office studies of representative structures.

In the probabilistic basis for LRFD (Ravindra and Galambos, 1978; Ellingwood et al., 1982), the load effects, Q, and the resistances, R, are modeled as statistically independent random variables. In Figure C-B3.1, relative frequency distributions for Q and R are portrayed as separate curves on a common plot for a hypothetical case. As long as the resistance, R, is greater than (to the right of) the effects of the loads, Q, a margin of safety for the particular limit state exists. However, because Q and R are random variables, there is a small probability that R may be less than Q. The probability of this limit state is related to the degree of overlap of the frequency distributions in Figure C-B3.1, which depends on the positioning of their mean values ( $ R_{m} $  versus  $ Q_{m} $ ) and their dispersions.

The probability that R is less than Q depends on the distributions of the many variables (material, loads, etc.) that determine resistance and total load effect. Often, only the means and the standard deviations or coefficients of variation of the variables involved in the determination of R and Q can be estimated. However, this information is sufficient to build an approximate design provision that is independent of the knowledge of these distributions, by stipulating the following design condition:

 $$ \beta\sqrt{V_{R}^{2}+V_{Q}^{2}}\leq\ln\left(R_{m}/Q_{m}\right) $$ 

where

 $ R_{m} $  = mean value of the resistance, R

 $ Q_{m}= $  mean value of the load effect, Q

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_13_img_in_chart_box_280_905_580_1138.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-B3.1. Frequency distribution of load effect, Q, and resistance, R.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_22.md -->

 $ V_{Q} $  = coefficient of variation of the load effect, Q

 $ V_{R} $  = coefficient of variation of the resistance, R

 $$ \beta = reliability index $$ 

For structural elements and the usual loading,  $ R_{m} $ ,  $ Q_{m} $ , and the coefficients of variation,  $ V_{R} $  and  $ V_{Q} $ , can be estimated, so a calculation of

 $$ \beta=\frac{\ln\left(R_{m}/Q_{m}\right)}{\sqrt{V_{R}^{2}+V_{Q}^{2}}} $$ 

will give a comparative measure of reliability of a structure or component. Extensions to the determination of  $ \beta $  in Equation C-B3-2 to accommodate additional probabilistic information and more complex design situations are described in Ellingwood et al. (1982) and have been used in the development of the recommended load combinations in ASCE/SEI 7.

The original studies that determined the statistical properties (mean values and coefficients of variation) for the basic material properties and for steel beams, columns, composite beams, plate girders, beam-columns, and connection elements that were used to develop the LRFD provisions are presented in a series of eight articles in the September 1978 issue of the Journal of the Structural Division (ASCE, 1978). The corresponding load statistics are given in Galambos et al. (1982). Based on these statistics, the values of  $ \beta $  inherent in the 1978 Specification for the Design, Fabrication, and Erection of Structural Steel for Buildings (AISC, 1978) were evaluated under different load combinations (live/dead, wind/dead, etc.) and for various tributary areas for typical members (beams, columns, beam-columns, structural components, etc.). As might be expected, there was a considerable variation in the range of  $ \beta $ -values. For example, compact rolled beams (flexure) and tension members (yielding) had  $ \beta $ -values that decreased from about 3.1 at L/D = 0.50 to 2.4 at L/D = 4. This decrease is a result of ASD applying the same factor to dead load, which is relatively predictable, and live load, which is more variable. For bolted or welded connections,  $ \beta $  was in the range of 4 to 5.

The variation in  $ \beta $  that was inherent to ASD is reduced substantially in LRFD by specifying several target  $ \beta $ -values and selecting load and resistance factors to meet these targets. The Committee on Specifications set the point at which LRFD is calibrated to ASD at L/D = 3.0 for braced compact beams in flexure and tension members at yield. The resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , for these limit states is 0.90, and the implied  $ \beta $  is approximately 2.6 for members and 4.0 for connections. The larger  $ \beta $ -value for connections reflects the complexity in modeling their behavior, effects of workmanship, and the benefit provided by additional strength. Limit states for other members are handled similarly.

The databases on steel strength used in previous editions of the LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986, 1993, 2000b) were based mainly on research conducted prior to 1970. An important study of the material properties of structural shapes (Bartlett et al., 2003) reflected changes in steel production methods and steel materials that had occurred over the 15 years since the original study. This study indicated that the new steel material characteristics did not warrant changes in the  $ \phi $ -values.

### 2. Design for Strength Using Allowable Strength Design (ASD)

The ASD method is provided in this Specification as an alternative to LRFD for use by engineers who prefer to deal with ASD load combinations. The term “allowable strength” has been introduced to emphasize that the basic equations of structural mechanics that underlie the provisions are the same for LRFD and ASD.

Traditional ASD is based on the concept that the maximum stress in a component shall not exceed a specified allowable stress under normal service conditions. The load effects are determined on the basis of an elastic analysis of the structure, while the allowable stress is the limiting stress (at yielding, instability, rupture, etc.) divided by a safety factor. The magnitude of the safety factor and the resulting allowable stress depend on the particular governing limit state against which the design must produce a certain margin of safety. For any single element, there may be a number of different allowable stresses that must be checked.

The safety factor in traditional ASD provisions was a function of both the material and the component being considered. It may have been influenced by factors such as member length, member behavior, load source, and anticipated quality of workmanship. The traditional safety factors were based solely on experience and had remained unchanged for over 50 years. Although ASD-designed structures have performed adequately over the years, the actual level of safety provided was never known. This was a principal drawback of the traditional ASD approach. An illustration of typical performance data is provided in Bjorhovde (1978), where theoretical and actual safety factors for columns are examined.

Design for strength by ASD is performed in accordance with Equation B3-2. The ASD method provided in the Specification recognizes that the controlling modes of failure are the same for structures designed by ASD and LRFD. Thus, the nominal strength that forms the foundation of LRFD is the same nominal strength that provides the foundation for ASD. When considering available strength, the only difference between the two methods is the resistance factor in LRFD,  $ \phi $ , and the safety factor in ASD,  $ \Omega $ .

In developing appropriate values of  $ \Omega $  for use in this Specification, the aim was to result in similar levels of safety and reliability for the two methods. A straightforward approach for relating the resistance factor and the safety factor was developed. The original LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986) was calibrated to the 1978 ASD Specification (AISC, 1978) at a live load-to-dead load ratio of 3. Thus, by equating the designs for the two methods at a live load-to-dead load ratio of 3, the relationship between  $ \phi $  and  $ \Omega $  can be determined. Using the live plus dead load combinations with L = 3D yields the following relationships.

For design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD)

 $$ \begin{aligned}\phi R_{n}=1.2D+1.6L&=1.2D+1.6(3D)=6D\\R_{n}&=\frac{6D}{\phi}\end{aligned} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_24.md -->

For design according to Section B3.2 (ASD)

 $$ \frac{R_{n}}{\Omega}=D+L=D+3D=4D $$ 

 $$ R_{n}=\Omega(4D) $$ 

Equating  $ R_{n} $  from the LRFD and ASD formulations and solving for  $ \Omega $  yields

 $$ \Omega=\frac{6D}{\phi}\Bigg(\frac{1}{4D}\Bigg)=\frac{1.5}{\phi} $$ 

Throughout this Specification, the values of  $ \Omega $  were obtained from the values of  $ \phi $  by Equation C-B3-5.

Based on Equation C-B3-5, the relationship between available strengths for LRFD and ASD is seen to be a constant of 1.5. However, that cannot be said for the relationship between required strengths for LRFD and ASD that are based on the load combinations given in ASCE/SEI 7. Thus, the exact level of safety will vary between LRFD and ASD. For the gravity load combinations given in Equations C-B3-3 and C-B3-4, and the assumed L=3D, ASD safety is equivalent to that for LRFD according to Equation C-B3-5. An alternative way to present the relationship between LRFD and ASD is to consider the ratio of the LRFD demand-to-capacity ratio  $ \left(DCR_{LRFD}=R_{u}/\phi R_{n}\right) $  to the ASD demand-to-capacity ratio  $ \left[DCR_{ASD}=R_{a}/\left(R_{n}/\Omega\right)\right] $  (Salmon et al., 2008). Thus,

 $$ \frac{DCR_{LRFD}}{DCR_{ASD}}=\frac{R_{u}/\phi R_{n}}{R_{a}/\left(R_{n}/\Omega\right)} $$ 

Equation C-B3-6 can be understood to provide the LRFD evaluation of an ASD design, with values below unity indicating that ASD is conservative with respect to LRFD and values above unity indicating that ASD is unconservative with respect to LRFD. With the parameters  $ R_{u}=1.2D+1.6L $ ,  $ R_{a}=D+L $ , and  $ \Omega=1.5/\phi $ , Equation C-B3-6 will provide ratios of DCRs ranging from 0.830 to 1.067. Values of L/D<3 have a ratio below unity (indicating ASD is conservative compared to LRFD) and values of L/D>3 have a ratio above unity (indicating ASD is unconservative compared to LRFD). The unconservative value of 1.067 is considered acceptable; such a minor difference does not have a significant effect on reliability.

A much larger variation in the ratio of DCRs may be observed for the ASCE/SEI 7 wind and earthquake lateral load combinations. For example, for members in which the ratio of the wind load effect to the dead load effect is high  $ (W/D > 3) $ , a situation that may be assumed for the design of several elements in a lateral force-resisting system such as diagonal braces and often the columns that support them, the ratio of the DCRs ranged from 0.90 to as high as 1.36 depending on the significance of second-order effects, which were varied from  $ B_{2} = 1.0 $  to 1.5, and the live load-to-dead load ratio, which was varied from L/D = 0 to 5. The L/D ratio was taken to apply to both the element and, for determination of second-order effects, the structure as a whole. With the exception of L/D < 0.2, all of the ratios of DCRs exceeded unity, with values exceeding 1.20 for the majority of the range of  $ B_{2} $  and L/D considered.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_25.md -->

The larger ratios of DCRs, values exceeding 1.2, were observed for  $ B_{2} $  values in excess of 1.1 and L/D ratios in excess of 2.0. It is noted that steel buildings with such  $ B_{2} $  values and L/D ratios may not be uncommon. Similar results were obtained for lateral load combinations including earthquake loads, E, although the ratio of DCRs tended to be smaller. Designers should thus be aware of the differences in design results between the two methods at these higher ratios of W/D, E/D, and L/D, with ASD potentially being less conservative than LRFD and having a lower level of safety and reliability.

One way to bring the safety and reliability of ASD into alignment with that of LRFD when considering lateral load combinations is to supplement the ASD lateral load combinations with LRFD lateral load combinations divided by 1.5. By also using an ASD/LRFD force level adjustment factor of  $ \alpha = 1.5 $  instead of  $ \alpha = 1.6 $ , as prescribed in Section C2, lateral systems designed using ASD will be exactly the same as those designed by LRFD. The resulting ASD designs would then be consistent with LRFD load combinations and would thus achieve the same level of safety and reliability as LRFD designs. A better approach, however, is to completely switch to design by LRFD. This will provide an approach to design with safety and reliability at a consistent level across all conditions.

### 3. Required Strength

This Specification permits the use of elastic or inelastic, which includes plastic, structural analysis. Generally, design is performed by elastic analysis. Provisions for inelastic and plastic analysis are given in Appendix 1. The required strength is determined by the appropriate methods of structural analysis.

In some circumstances, as in the proportioning of stability bracing members that carry no calculated forces (see, for example, Appendix 6), the required strength is explicitly stated in this Specification.

### 4. Design of Connections and Supports

This section provides the charging language for Chapter J and Chapter K on the design of connections and supports. Chapter J covers the proportioning of the individual elements of a connection (angles, welds, bolts, etc.) once the load effects on the connection are known. According to the provisions of this section, the modeling assumptions associated with the structural analysis must be consistent with the conditions used in Chapter J to proportion the connecting elements.

In many situations, it is not necessary to include the connection elements as part of the analysis of the structural system. For example, simple and fully restrained (FR) connections may often be idealized as pinned or fixed, respectively, for the purposes of structural analysis. Once the analysis has been completed, the deformations or forces computed at the joints may be used to proportion the connection elements. The classifications of FR and simple connections are meant to justify these idealizations for analysis with the provision that if, for example, one assumes a connection to be FR for the purposes of analysis, the actual connection must meet the FR conditions. In other words, it must have adequate strength and stiffness, as described in the provisions, and discussed in the following.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_13/doc_26.md -->

In certain cases, the deformation of the connection elements affects the way the structure resists load and hence the connections must be included in the analysis of the structural system. These connections are referred to as partially restrained (PR) moment connections. For structures with PR connections, the connection flexibility must be estimated and included in the structural analysis, as described in the following sections. Once the analysis is complete, the load effects and deformations computed for the connection can be used to check the adequacy of the connecting elements.

For simple and FR connections, the connection proportions are established after the final analysis of the structural design is completed, thereby greatly simplifying the design cycle. In contrast, the design of PR connections (like member selection) is inherently iterative because one must assume values of the connection proportions in order to establish the force-deformation characteristics of the connection needed to perform the structural analysis. The life-cycle performance characteristics must also be considered. The adequacy of the assumed proportions of the connection elements can be verified once the outcome of the structural analysis is known. If the connection elements are inadequate, then the values must be revised and the structural analysis repeated. The potential benefits of using PR connections for various types of framing systems are discussed in the literature referenced in the following.

Connection Classification. The basic assumption made in classifying connections is that the most important behavioral characteristics of the connection can be modeled by a moment-rotation, M- $ \theta $ , curve. Figure C-B3.2 shows a typical M- $ \theta $  curve. Implicit in the moment-rotation curve is the definition of the connection as being a region of the column and beam along with the connecting elements. The connection response is defined this way because the rotation of the member in a physical test is generally measured over a length that incorporates the contributions of not only the connecting elements, but also the ends of the members being connected and the column panel zone.

Examples of connection classification schemes include those in Bjorhovde et al. (1990) and Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005a). These classifications account directly for the stiffness, strength, and ductility of the connections.

Connection Stiffness. Because the nonlinear behavior of the connection manifests itself even at low moment-rotation levels, the initial stiffness of the connection,  $ K_{i} $ , (shown in Figure C-B3.2) does not adequately characterize connection response at service levels. Furthermore, many connection types do not exhibit a reliable initial stiffness, or it exists only for a very small moment-rotation range. The secant stiffness,  $ K_{s} $ , at service loads is taken as an index property of connection stiffness. Specifically,

 $$ K_{s}=M_{s}/\theta_{s} $$ 

where

 $$ M_{s}=moment at service loads,kip-in.(N-mm) $$ 

 $$ \theta_{s}=rotation at service loads,rad $$ 

In the following discussion, L and EI are the length and bending rigidity, respectively, of the beam.

If  $ K_{s}L/EI \geq 20 $ , it is acceptable to consider the connection to be fully restrained (in other words, able to maintain the angles between members). If  $ K_{s}L/EI \leq 2 $ , it is acceptable to consider the connection to be simple (in other words, it rotates without developing moment). Connections with stiffnesses between these two limits are partially restrained and the stiffness, strength, and ductility of the connection must be considered in the design (Leon, 1994). Examples of FR, PR, and simple connection response curves are shown in Figure C-B3.3. The points marked  $ \theta_{s} $  indicate the service load states for the example connections and thereby define the secant stiffnesses for those connections.

Connection Strength. The strength of a connection is the maximum moment that it is capable of carrying,  $ M_{n} $ , as shown in Figure C-B3.2. The strength of a connection can be determined on the basis of an ultimate limit-state model of the connection, or from physical tests. If the moment-rotation response does not exhibit a peak load then the strength can be taken as the moment at a rotation of 0.02 rad (Hsieh and Deierlein, 1991; Leon et al., 1996).

It is also useful to define a lower limit on strength below which the connection may be treated as a simple connection. Connections that transmit less than 20% of the fully plastic moment of the beam at a rotation of 0.02 rad may be considered to have no flexural strength for design. However, it should be recognized that the aggregate strength of many weak connections can be important when compared to that of a few strong connections (FEMA, 1997).

In Figure C-B3.3, the points marked  $ M_{n} $  indicate the maximum strength states of the example connections. The points marked  $ \theta_{u} $  indicate the maximum rotation states of the example connections. Note that it is possible for an FR connection to have a strength less than the strength of the beam. It is also possible for a PR connection to have a strength greater than the strength of the beam. The strength of the connection must be adequate to resist the moment demands implied by the design loads.

Connection Ductility. If the connection strength substantially exceeds the fully plastic moment strength of the beam, then the ductility of the structural system is controlled by the beam and the connection can be considered elastic. If the connection strength only marginally exceeds the fully plastic moment strength of the beam, then the connection may experience substantial inelastic deformation before the beam reaches its full strength. If the beam strength exceeds the connection strength, then deformations can concentrate in the connection. The ductility required of a connection will depend upon the particular application. For example, the ductility requirement for a braced frame in a nonseismic area will generally be less than the ductility required in a high seismic area. The rotation ductility requirements for seismic design depend upon the structural system (AISC, 2022c).

In Figure C-B3.2, the rotation capacity,  $ \theta_{u} $ , can be defined as the value of the connection rotation at the point where either (a) the resisting strength of the connection has dropped to  $ 0.8M_{n} $  or (b) the connection has deformed beyond 0.03 rad. This second criterion is intended to apply to connections where there is no loss in strength until very large rotations occur. It is not prudent to rely on these large rotations in design.

The available rotation capacity,  $ \theta_{u} $ , should be compared with the rotation required at the strength limit state, as determined by an analysis that takes into account the nonlinear behavior of the connection. (Note that for design by ASD, the rotation required at the strength limit state should be assessed using analyses conducted at 1.6 times the ASD load combinations.) In the absence of an accurate analysis, a rotation capacity of 0.03 rad is considered adequate. This rotation is equal to the minimum beam-to-column connection capacity as specified in the seismic provisions for special moment frames (AISC, 2022c). Many types of PR connections, such as top- and seat-angle connections, meet this criterion.

Structural Analysis and Design. When a connection is classified as PR, the relevant response characteristics of the connection must be included in the analysis of the structure to determine the member and connection forces, displacements, and the frame stability. Therefore, PR construction requires, first, that the moment-rotation characteristics of the connection be known and, second, that these characteristics be incorporated in the analysis and member design.

Typical moment-rotation curves for many PR connections are available from one of several databases (Goverdhan, 1983; Ang and Morris, 1984; Nethercot, 1985; Kishi and Chen, 1986). Care should be exercised when utilizing tabulated moment-rotation curves not to extrapolate to sizes or conditions beyond those used to develop the database because other failure modes may control (ASCE, 1997). When the connections to be modeled do not fall within the range of the databases, it may be possible to determine the response characteristics from tests, simple component modeling, or finite element studies (FEMA, 1995). Examples of procedures to model connection behavior are given in the literature (Bjorhovde et al., 1988; Chen and Lui, 1991; Bjorhovde et al., 1992; Lorenz et al., 1993; Chen and Toma, 1994; Chen et al., 1995; Bjorhovde et al., 1996; Leon et al., 1996; Leon and Easterling, 2002; Bijlaard et al., 2005; Bjorhovde et al., 2008).

The degree of sophistication of the analysis depends on the problem at hand. Design for PR construction usually requires separate analyses for the serviceability and strength limit states. For serviceability, an analysis using linear springs with a stiffness given by  $ K_{s} $  (see Figure C-B3.2) is sufficient if the resistance demanded of the connection is well below the strength. When subjected to strength load combinations, a procedure is needed whereby the characteristics assumed in the analysis are consistent with those of the connection response. The response is especially nonlinear as the applied moment approaches the connection strength. In particular, the effect of the connection nonlinearity on second-order moments and other stability checks needs to be considered (ASCE, 1997). The use of the direct analysis method with PR connections has been demonstrated (Surovek et al., 2005; White and Goverdhan, 2008).

### 5. Design of Diaphragms and Collectors

This section provides charging language for the design of structural steel components (members and their connections) of diaphragms and collector systems.

Diaphragms transfer in-plane lateral loads to the lateral force-resisting system. Typical diaphragm elements in a building structure are the floor and roof systems, which accumulate lateral forces due to gravity, wind, and/or seismic loads, and distribute these forces to individual elements (braced frames, moment frames, shear walls, etc.) of the vertically oriented lateral force-resisting system of the building structure. Collectors (also known as drag struts) are often used to collect and deliver diaphragm forces to the lateral force-resisting system.

Diaphragms are classified into one of three categories: rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible. Rigid diaphragms distribute the in-plane forces to the lateral force-resisting system with negligible in-plane deformation of the diaphragm. A rigid diaphragm may be assumed to distribute the lateral loads in proportion to the relative stiffness of the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_0.md -->

individual elements of the lateral force-resisting system. A semi-rigid diaphragm distributes the lateral loads in proportion to the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm and the relative stiffness of the individual elements of the lateral force-resisting system. With a flexible diaphragm, the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm is negligible compared to the stiffness of the lateral force-resisting system and, therefore, the distribution of lateral forces is independent of the relative stiffness of the individual elements of the lateral force-resisting system. In this case, the distribution of lateral forces may be computed in a manner analogous to a series of simple beams spanning between the lateral force-resisting system elements.

Diaphragms should be designed for the shear, moment, and axial forces resulting from the design loads. The diaphragm response may be considered analogous to a deep beam where the flanges (often referred to as chords of the diaphragm) develop tension and compression forces, and the web resists the shear. The component elements of the diaphragm need to have strength and deformation capacity consistent with the assumptions and intended behavior.

### 6. Design of Anchorages to Concrete

This section provides the charging language for Chapter I and Chapter J on design of anchorages to concrete.

### 7. Design for Stability

This section provides the charging language for Chapter C on design for stability.

### 8. Design for Serviceability

This section provides the charging language for Chapter L on design for serviceability.

### 9. Design for Structural Integrity

This section provides the minimum connection design criteria for satisfying structural integrity requirements where required by the applicable building code. Section 1616 of the International Building Code (ICC, 2021) assigns structural integrity requirements to high-rise buildings in risk category III or IV, which means that the number of buildings to which this requirement currently applies is limited.

Evaluation of built structures that have been subjected to extraordinary events indicates that structures that have a higher level of connectivity perform better than those that do not. The intent of the integrity requirements is to achieve this improved connectivity by limiting the possibility of a connection failure when it is subjected to unanticipated tension forces. The forces can result from a wide range of events such as cool-down after a fire, failure of adjacent structural members, and blast or impact loads on columns. The Specification integrity checks are similar in principle to those defined in other model codes and international codes that have provided good historical performance (Geschwindner and Gustafson, 2010). The fundamental aspect of the integrity requirement is that it is a connection design requirement only and is not a design force applied to any part of the structure other than the connection itself. In addition, the forces determined for the integrity check are not to be combined with any other forces and the integrity connection design check is to be conducted

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_1.md -->

separately. The structural integrity requirements are a detailing requirement for the connection and not a load or force applied to the structure.

Section B3.9(a) provides the nominal tensile strength for column splices. The intent of this requirement is to provide a minimum splice capacity for the resistance of unanticipated forces. This requirement is based on the assumption that two floors are supported by the splice. Any live load reduction should be the same as that used for the design of the connections of the floor members framing to the column. The tension design force should be distributed reasonably uniformly between the flanges and web so that some bending and shear capacity is provided in addition to the tension capacity. A load path for this tension force does not need to be provided.

Section B3.9(b) provides the minimum nominal axial tensile strength of the end connection of beams that frame to girders and also for beams or girders that frame to columns. Geschwindner and Gustafson (2010) have shown that single-plate connections designed to resist shear according to this Specification will satisfy this requirement. Because inelastic deformation is permitted for the integrity check, it is expected that most other framed connections, such as double-angle connections, can be shown to satisfy this requirement through nonlinear analysis or yield line analysis. The forces determined in this section are to be applied to only the connection design itself and are not to be included in the member design. In particular, checking the local bending of column and beam webs induced by the tension is not required by this section.

Section B3.9(c) provides the minimum nominal tensile force to brace columns. Maintaining column bracing is one of the fundamental principles for providing structural integrity. Because column bracing elements are usually much lighter than the column, extraordinary events have more potential to affect the bracing member or the slab surrounding the column than the column itself. This is the reason that the steel connection itself is required to provide the bracing force. The assumption is that the extraordinary event has compromised the ability of the column to be braced by the slab or by one of the beams framing to the column. This tensile bracing force requirement is to be applied separately from other bracing requirements, as specified in Appendix 6. Note that the requirements of this section will usually govern for the lower stories of high-rise buildings, whereas Section B3.9(a) will govern in most other situations.

Although the integrity requirements need be applied only when required by code, they should be considered for any building where improved structural performance under undefined extraordinary events is desired. For structures that have a defined extraordinary load, reference should be made to ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022). For structures that are required to be designed to resist progressive (disproportionate) collapse, reference should be made to the ASCE/SEI 7 Commentary.

### 10. Design for Ponding

As used in this Specification, ponding refers to the retention of water due solely to the deflection of roof framing under all loads (including dead loads) present at the onset of ponding and the subsequent accumulation of rainwater and snowmelt. The amount of accumulated water is dependent on the stiffness of the roof's structural framing system. Unbounded incremental deflections due to the incremental increase

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_2.md -->

in retained water can result in the collapse of the roof. The problem becomes catastrophic when more water causes more deflection, resulting in a greater opportunity for more water to accumulate until the roof collapses.

The Specification requires that design for ponding be considered if water is impounded on the roof, irrespective of roof slope. Camber and deflections due to loads acting concurrently with rain loads must be considered in establishing the initial conditions.

Determination of ponding stability is typically done by structural analysis where the rain loads are increased by the incremental deflections of the structural framing system to the accumulated rainwater, assuming the primary roof drains are blocked.

Previous editions of this Specification detailed provisions and design aids for determining ponding stability and strength in Appendix 2. These methods were applicable to a limited class of roof configurations and were inconsistent with the remainder of the Specification. For these reasons, they have been removed, and methods and discussions for analyzing and designing for ponding stability may be found in SJI Technical Digest 3, Structural Design of Steel Joist Roofs to Resist Ponding Loads (Fisher and Denavit, 2018).

### 11. Design for Fatigue

Fatigue is a limit state that must be considered like other limit states but only in specific applications. There are situations where fatigue may be a controlling limit state, such as in crane runways and their supports. Experience has shown that the cyclic loading associated with the effects of wind or snow loading on typical building systems does not cause fatigue because the number of high stress-range cycles is typically low enough to preclude fatigue crack initiation.

Appendix 3 deals with high cycle, low stress-range fatigue; while seismic loading is also cyclic, it involves low cycle, high stress-range fatigue, which is not considered in Appendix 3. The effects of low cycle fatigue are implicitly considered in the requirements of the AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2022c), and the AISC Prequalified Connections for Special and Intermediate Steel Moment Frames for Seismic Applications (AISC, 2022b).

### 12. Design for Fire Conditions

This section provides the charging language for Appendix 4 on structural design for fire resistance. Both alternatives, (a) qualification testing and (b) analysis, are deemed acceptable for providing fire resistance. Design by analysis is addressed in Appendix 4, Sections 4.1 and 4.2. Qualification testing is addressed in Appendix 4, Section 4.3, which includes relevant provisions reproduced from the International Building Code (ICC, 2018), ASCE/SEI/SFPE Standard 29 (ASCE, 2005), ASTM E119 (ASTM, 2020d), and similar documents.

### 13. Design for Corrosion Effects

Steel members may deteriorate in some service environments. This deterioration may appear either as external corrosion, which would be visible upon inspection,

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_3.md -->

or in undetected changes that would reduce member strength. The designer should recognize these problems by either factoring a specific amount of tolerance for damage into the design or providing adequate protection (for example, coatings or cathodic protection) and/or planned maintenance programs so that such problems do not occur.

Because the interior of a hollow structural section (HSS) is difficult to inspect, some concern has been expressed regarding internal corrosion. However, good design practice can eliminate the concern and the need for expensive protection. Corrosion occurs in the presence of oxygen and water. In an enclosed building, it is improbable that there would be sufficient reintroduction of moisture to cause severe corrosion. Therefore, internal corrosion protection is a consideration only in HSS exposed to weather.

In a sealed HSS, internal corrosion cannot progress beyond the point where the oxygen or moisture necessary for chemical oxidation is consumed (AISI, 1970). The oxidation depth is insignificant when the corrosion process must stop, even when a corrosive atmosphere exists at the time of sealing. If fine openings exist at connections, moisture and air can enter the HSS through capillary action or by aspiration due to the partial vacuum that is created if the HSS is cooled rapidly (Blodgett, 1967). This can be prevented by providing pressure-equalizing holes in locations that make it impossible for water to flow into the HSS by gravity.

Situations where conservative practice would recommend an internal protective coating include (a) open HSS where changes in the air volume by ventilation or direct flow of water is possible, and (b) open HSS subjected to a temperature gradient that would cause condensation.

HSS that are filled or partially filled with concrete should not be sealed. In the event of fire, water in the concrete will vaporize and may create pressure sufficient to burst a sealed HSS. Care should be taken to keep water from remaining in the HSS during or after construction, because the expansion caused by freezing can create pressure that is sufficient to burst an HSS.

Galvanized HSS assemblies should not be completely sealed because rapid pressure changes during the galvanizing process tend to burst sealed assemblies.

### B4. MEMBER PROPERTIES

### 1. Classification of Sections for Local Buckling

Cross sections with a limiting width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda $ , greater than those provided in Table B4.1 are subject to local buckling limit states. Since the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), Table B4.1 has been separated into two parts: B4.1a for compression members and B4.1b for flexural members. Separation of Table B4.1 into two parts reflects the fact that compression members are only categorized as either slender or nonslender, while flexural members may be slender, noncompact, or compact. In addition, separation of Table B4.1 into two parts clarifies ambiguities in  $ \lambda_{r} $ . The width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda_{r} $ , may be different for columns and beams, even for the same element in a cross section, reflecting both the underlying stress state of the connected elements and the different design methodologies between columns,

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_4.md -->

Chapter E and Appendix 1, and beams, Chapter F and Appendix 1. A comprehensive review of the basis for the local buckling width-to-thickness limits of Table B4.1 is presented by Schafer et al. (2022).

Limiting Width-to-Thickness Ratios for Compression Elements in Members Subjected to Axial Compression. Compression members containing any elements with width-to-thickness ratios greater than  $ \lambda_{r} $  provided in Table B4.1a are designated as slender and are subject to the local buckling reductions detailed in Section E7. Nonslender compression members (all elements having width-to-thickness ratio  $ \leq\lambda_{r} $ ) are not subject to local buckling reductions.

Flanges of Built-Up I-Shaped Sections. In the 1993 Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 1993), for built-up I-shaped sections under axial compression (Case 2 in Table B4.1a), modifications were made to the flange local buckling criterion to include web-flange interaction. The  $ k_{c} $  in the  $ \lambda_{r} $  limit is the same as that used for flexural members. Theory indicates that the web-flange interaction in axial compression is at least as severe as in flexure. Rolled shapes are excluded from this provision because there are no standard sections with proportions where the interaction would occur at commonly available yield stresses. In built-up sections where the interaction causes a reduction in the flange local buckling strength, it is likely that the web is also a thin stiffened element. The  $ k_{c} $  factor accounts for the interaction of flange and web local buckling demonstrated in experiments reported in Johnson (1985). The maximum limit of 0.76 corresponds to  $ F_{cr} = 0.69E/\lambda^{2} $ , which was used as the local buckling strength in earlier editions of both the ASD and LRFD Specifications. An  $ h/t_{w} = 27.5 $  is required to reach  $ k_{c} = 0.76 $ . Fully fixed restraint for an unstiffened compression element corresponds to  $ k_{c} = 1.3 $  while zero restraint gives  $ k_{c} = 0.42 $ . Because of web-flange interactions, it is possible to get  $ k_{c} < 0.42 $  from the  $ k_{c} $  formula. If  $ h/t_{w} > 5.70\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , use  $ h/t_{w} = 5.70\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  in the  $ k_{c} $  equation, which corresponds to the 0.35 limit.

Rectangular HSS in Compression. The limits for rectangular HSS walls in uniform compression (Case 6 in Table B4.1a) have been used in AISC Specifications since 1969 (AISC, 1969). They are based on Winter (1968), where adjacent stiffened compression elements in box sections of uniform thickness were observed to provide negligible torsional restraint for one another along their corner edges.

Round HSS in Compression. The  $ \lambda_{r} $  limit for round HSS in compression (Case 9 in Table B4.1a) was first used in the 1978 Specification for the Design, Fabrication, and Erection of Structural Steel for Buildings (AISC, 1978). It was recommended in Schilling (1965) based upon research reported in Winter (1968). Excluding the use of round HSS with  $ D/t > 0.45E/F_{y} $  was also recommended in Schilling (1965). This is implied in Sections E7 and F8 where no criteria are given for round HSS with D/t greater than this limit.

Limiting Width-to-Thickness Ratios for Compression Elements in Members Subjected to Flexure. Flexural members containing compression elements, all with width-to-thickness ratios less than or equal to  $ \lambda_{p} $  as provided in Table B4.1b, are designated as compact. Compact sections are capable of developing a fully plastic stress

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_5.md -->

distribution and they typically possess a rotation capacity,  $ R_{cap} $ , of approximately 3 (see Figure C-A-1.2) before the onset of local buckling (Yura et al., 1978). Flexural members containing any compression element with width-to-thickness ratios greater than  $ \lambda_{p} $ , but still with all compression elements having width-to-thickness ratios less than or equal to  $ \lambda_{r} $ , are designated as noncompact. Noncompact sections can develop partial yielding in compression elements before local buckling occurs but will not resist inelastic local buckling at the strain levels required for a fully plastic stress distribution. Flexural members containing any compression elements with width-to-thickness ratios greater than  $ \lambda_{r} $  are designated as slender. Slender-element sections have one or more compression elements that will buckle elastically before the yield stress is achieved. Noncompact and slender-element sections are subject to flange local buckling or web local buckling reductions as provided in Chapter F, and summarized in Table User Note F1.1, and in Appendix 1.

The values of the limiting ratios,  $ \lambda_{p} $  and  $ \lambda_{r} $ , specified in Table B4.1b are similar to those in the 1989 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings—Allowable Stress Design and Plastic Design (AISC, 1989) and Table 2.3.3.3 of Galambos (1978), except that  $ \lambda_{p}=0.38\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , limited in Galambos (1978) to determinate beams and to indeterminate beams when moments are determined by elastic analysis, was adopted for all conditions on the basis of Yura et al. (1978). For greater inelastic rotation capacities than provided by the limiting value of  $ \lambda_{p} $  given in Table B4.1b or for structures in areas of high seismicity, see AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings, Chapter D and Table D1.1 (AISC, 2022c).

Webs in Flexure. In the 2010 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2010), and continuing for this Specification, formulas for  $ \lambda_{p} $  were added as Case 16 in Table B4.1b for I-shaped beams with unequal flanges based on White (2008). In extreme cases where the plastic neutral axis is located in the compression flange,  $ h_{p}=0 $  and the web is considered to be compact.

Rectangular HSS in Flexure. The  $ \lambda_{p} $  limit for compact sections is adopted from Limit States Design of Steel Structures (CSA, 2009). Lower values of  $ \lambda_{p} $  are specified for high-seismic design in the AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2022c), based upon tests (Lui and Goel, 1987) that have shown that rectangular HSS braces subjected to reversed axial load fracture catastrophically under relatively few cycles if a local buckle forms. This was confirmed in tests (Sherman, 1995a) where rectangular HSS braces sustained over 500 cycles when a local buckle did not form, even though general column buckling had occurred, but failed in less than 40 cycles when a local buckle developed. Since 2005, the  $ \lambda_{p} $  limit for webs in rectangular HSS flexural members (Case 19 in Table B4.1b) has been reduced from  $ \lambda_{p}=3.76\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  to  $ \lambda_{p}=2.42\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  based on the work of Wilkinson and Hancock (1998, 2002).

Box Sections in Flexure. Since the 2016 Specification (AISC, 2016), box sections have been defined separately from rectangular HSS. Thus, Case 21 in Table B4.1b addresses flanges of box sections and Case 19 addresses webs of box sections.

Round HSS in Flexure. The  $ \lambda_{p} $  values for round HSS in flexure (Case 20, Table B4.1b) are based on Sherman (1976), Sherman and Tanavde (1984), and Ziemian

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_6.md -->

(2010). Beyond this, the local buckling strength decreases rapidly, making it impractical to use these sections in building construction.

Limiting Width-to-Thickness Ratios Where the Web and Flange are not Continuously Attached. The Specification does not explicitly provide requirements for cases where the cross-section elements are not continuously attached; this is due to the fact that the buckling occurs over a short length and it is generally not practical to provide less than continuous connection and still limit local buckling. Of course, a stiffened element with one longitudinal edge intermittently connected may be conservatively considered as an unstiffened element for the purposes of determining limiting width-to-thickness ratios.

If an intermittent connection is to provide restraint similar to a continuous connection, it must provide adequate stiffness and strength at a spacing within the local buckling half-wavelength of the cross-section element, in other words, at a spacing less than approximately one-half the width-to-thickness ratio from Table B4.1 multiplied times the thickness. In general, width-to-thickness ratios similar to those in Table B4.1 can be derived if the local buckling stress,  $ F_{cr} $ , is accurately known. In classic form, the local buckling stress is expressed as

 $$ F_{cr}=k\frac{\pi^{2}E}{12\Big(1-\mathrm{v}^{2}\Big)}\Bigg(\frac{t}{b}\Bigg)^{2} $$ 

and is, therefore, a function of the material properties, dimensions, loading, and boundary conditions as reflected through the plate buckling coefficient, k; see Ziemian (2010). As detailed in Seif and Schafer (2010), if  $ F_{cr} $  is known, then the limiting width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda_{r} $ , from Table B4.1 is the b/t such that  $ \sqrt{F_{y}/F_{cr}} = 0.7 $  for elements in compression and = 1.0 for elements in flexure. The limiting width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda_{p} $ , from Table B4.1b is the b/t such that  $ \sqrt{F_{y}/F_{cr}} = 0.46 $  for unstiffened elements and = 0.58 for stiffened elements. Thus, if the engineer can approximate k, or perform a local buckling analysis consistent with the intermittent connections for finding  $ F_{cr} $ , then a limiting width-to-thickness ratio may be approximated. For an intermittently connected plate, AISI (2016) uses the approximation of a pin-ended column of length equal to the connector spacing for determining  $ F_{cr} $ . For complex connection conditions, the provisions of Appendix 1 may provide an alternative path for Specification-compliant design.

### 2. Design Wall Thickness for HSS

ASTM A500/A500M tolerances allow for a wall thickness that is not greater than  $ \pm10\% $  of the nominal value. Because the plate and strip from which these HSS are made are produced to a much smaller thickness tolerance, manufacturers in the United States consistently produce these HSS with a wall thickness that is near the lower-bound wall thickness limit. Consequently, AISC and the Steel Tube Institute of North America (STI) recommend that 0.93 times the nominal wall thickness be used for calculations involving engineering design properties of these HSS. This results in a weight (mass) variation that is similar to that found in other structural shapes. The design wall thickness and section properties based upon this reduced thickness have been tabulated in AISC and STI publications since 1997.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_7.md -->

Two new HSS material standards were added to the 2016 Specification (AISC, 2016). ASTM A1085/A1085M is a standard in which the wall thickness is permitted to be no more than 5% under the nominal thickness and the mass is permitted to be no more than 3.5% under the nominal mass. This is in addition to a Charpy V-notch toughness limit and a limit on the range of yield strength that makes ASTM A1085/A1085M suitable for seismic applications. With these tolerances, the design wall thickness may be taken as the nominal thickness of the HSS. Other acceptable HSS products that do not have the same thickness and mass tolerances must still use the design thickness as 0.93 times the nominal thickness as discussed previously.

The other material standard added to the 2016 Specification was ASTM A1065/A1065M. These HSS are produced by cold-forming two C-shaped sections and joining them with two electric-fusion seam welds to form a square or rectangular HSS. These sections are available in larger sizes than those produced in a tube mill. Because the thickness meets plate tolerance limits, the design wall thickness may be taken as the nominal thickness. Prior to the 2016 AISC Specification, they were classified as box sections because they were not produced according to an ASTM standard. With the ASTM A1065/A1065M standard, they are included as acceptable HSS and the term box section is used for sections made by corner welding four plates to form a hollow box.

### 3. Gross and Net Area Determination

### 3 a. Gross Area

Gross area is the total area of the cross section without deductions for holes or ineffective portions of elements subjected to local buckling.

### 3 b. Net Area

The net area is based on net width and load transfer at a particular chain. Because of possible damage around a bolt hole during drilling or punching operations,  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) is added to the nominal bolt hole diameter when computing the net area for tension or shear.

Unless indicated otherwise, the net area associated with net tensile checks in the Specification assumes the material that is removed represents bolt holes formed in accordance with Section M2.5. For statically loaded structures, open bolt holes and bolt holes filled with snug-tight or pretensioned bolts can be treated identically relative to the net area and net tensile checks. Holes for plug, slot, or fillet welds in holes or slots are treated in the same manner as bolt holes.

### B7. EVALUATION OF EXISTING STRUCTURES

Section B7 provides the charging language for Appendix 5 on the evaluation of existing structures.

### B8. DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCES

This new section replaces Section M2.7, Dimensional Tolerances, in the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016).

Dimensional tolerances (and production methods) are used to limit the magnitude of geometric imperfections present in members and structures. In some instances there is a direct relationship between the permitted dimensional tolerances of the member or structure and the design provisions provided in this Specification. Geometric imperfections have the most significant effect relative to the stability of the members and structures. Evaluation of members and structures outside the assumed tolerances falls outside the scope of this Specification and should be based on tests or analysis, subject to the approval of the authority having jurisdiction.

There are a number of conditions that could result in geometric imperfections greater than those assumed in the Specification being present in structural steel elements.

• Engineers sometimes elect to employ materials that are not approved for use. In such cases, the tolerances imposed by the standards for the chosen material may exceed those permitted by comparable ASTM standards or no tolerances may be enforced at all. Engineers must therefore either specify tighter tolerances consistent with those assumed in the Specification or must account for the larger possible tolerances in their designs.

• The AISC Code Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (AISC, 2022a), hereafter referred to as the Code of Standard Practice does not address every possible variation that could be encountered in practice. When a tolerance that is not specified in the Code of Standard Practice is required so that the fabricated and erected structural steel satisfy the design intent, the tolerance should be specified in the contract documents. In some instances, it may be impractical to satisfy tolerances comparable to those provided in the Code of Standard Practice or the ASTM standards. In such cases, engineers must account for the larger permitted tolerances in their designs.

• For various reasons, structural steel elements are sometimes unintentionally provided out-of-tolerance. In some instances, the problem may be discovered at a point where repair of the element is impractical or unsafe. In such cases, engineers must account for the larger permitted tolerances in their designs and reinforcement of the member may be an option.

The classification of sections for local buckling in Section B4.1 assumes tolerances and production methods inherent in the ASTM standards approved for use under this Specification in Section A3.1a. The limiting width-to-thickness ratios,  $ \lambda_{r} $  and  $ \lambda_{p} $ , may have to be adjusted if larger geometric imperfections exist. Chapter C permits the use of any rational method of design for stability as long as the listed effects are considered. Geometric imperfections is one of the effects that must be considered. The effect of geometric imperfections larger than those permitted in the ASTM.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_9.md -->

standards approved for use under this Specification is not addressed in the effective length method, the first-order analysis method, and the approximate second-order analysis method. The use of these methods where such geometric imperfections exist or are permitted is not consistent with the intent of the Specification. The available compressive strength determined in Chapter E and the minimum strength and stiffness to provide a braced point determined in Appendix 6 also assume that dimensional tolerances provided in the Code of Standard Practice and in the ASTM standards are satisfied.

AISC Design Guide 28, Stability Design of Steel Buildings (Griffis and White, 2013), provides guidance relative to addressing geometric imperfections other than those assumed in the Specification.

There are also conditions for which geometric imperfections may have negligible effect on the strength of the element. Out-of-straightness within reasonable tolerances does not affect the strength of tension members. Applied tension tends to reduce, whereas compression tends to amplify, out-of-straightness. Sometimes cambering of beams can result in distortion of the web. Lateral deflection or out-of-flatness of webs of girders subjected to static loading is of no structural significance.

# CHAPTER C DESIGN FOR STABILITY

Chapter C has no major changes or additions in this edition of the Specification.

Design for stability is the combination of analysis to determine the required strengths of components and proportioning of components to have adequate available strengths. Various methods are available to provide for stability (Ziemian, 2010).

Chapter C addresses the stability design requirements for steel buildings and other structures. It is based upon the direct analysis method, which can be used in all cases. The effective length method and first-order analysis method are addressed in Appendix 7 as alternative methods of design for stability, and may be used when the limits in Appendix 7, Sections 7.2.1 and 7.3.1, respectively, are satisfied. A complete discussion of each of these methods, along with example problems, may be found in AISC Design Guide 28, Stability Design of Steel Buildings (Griffis and White, 2013). Other approaches are permitted provided the general requirements in Section C1 are satisfied. For example, Appendix 1 provides logical extensions to the direct analysis method, in which design provisions are provided for explicitly modeling member imperfections and inelasticity. First-order elastic structural analysis without stiffness reductions for inelasticity is not sufficient to assess stability because the analysis and the equations for component strengths are inextricably interdependent.

### C1. GENERAL STABILITY REQUIREMENTS

There are many parameters and behavioral effects that influence the stability of steel-framed structures (Birnstiel and Iffland, 1980; McGuire, 1992; White and Chen, 1993; ASCE, 1997; Ziemian, 2010). The stability of structures and individual elements must be considered from the standpoint of the structure as a whole, including not only compression members, but also beams, bracing systems, and connections.

Many building codes include stiffness requirements for control of seismic drift, which act as an indirect limit on sideway amplification. ASCE/SEI 7, Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE, 2022), directly limits a stability coefficient,  $ \theta $ , (approximately equal to  $ 1-1/B_{2} $ ) to 0.25 for seismic design of buildings, effectively requiring that  $ \Delta_{2nd-order}/\Delta_{1st-order} $  calculated with nominal stiffness, not exceed a value of 1.33 if  $ P_{mf}=0 $  nor 1.44 if  $ P_{mf}=P_{story} $  (Sabelli and Griffis, 2021). This limit is well within the more general recommendation that sideway amplification, calculated with reduced stiffness, should be equal to or less than 2.5. The latter recommendation is made because at larger levels of amplification, small changes in gravity load and/or structural stiffness can result in relatively larger changes in sideway deflections and second-order effects, due to large geometric nonlinearities.

Table C-C1.1 shows how the five general requirements, provided in Section C1, are addressed in the direct analysis method (Sections C2 and C3) and the effective length method (Appendix 7, Section 7.2). The first-order analysis method (Appendix 7,

Section 7.3) is not included in Table C-C1.1 because it addresses these requirements in an indirect manner using a mathematical manipulation of the direct analysis method. The additional lateral load required in Appendix 7, Section 7.3.2(a), is calibrated to achieve roughly the same result as the collective effects of notional loads required in Section C2.2b,  $ P-\Delta $  effects required in Section C2.1(b), and the stiffness reduction required in Section C2.3. Additionally, a  $ B_{1} $  multiplier addresses  $ P-\delta $  effects as defined in Appendix 8, Section 8.1.2.

In the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), uncertainties in stiffness and strength was added to the list of effects that should be considered when designing for stability.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_12.md -->

Although all methods detailed in this Specification, including the direct analysis method, the effective length method, and the first-order elastic method, satisfy this requirement, the effect is listed so that it is clear that it is to be included, along with the original four other effects, when any other rational method of designing for stability is employed.

### C2. CALCULATION OF REQUIRED STRENGTHS

Analysis to determine required strengths in accordance with this section and the assessment of member and connection available strengths in accordance with Section C3 form the basis of the direct analysis method of design for stability. This method is useful for the stability design of all structural steel systems, including moment frames, braced frames, shear walls, and combinations of these and similar systems (AISC-SSRC, 2003a). While the precise formulation of this method is unique to the Specification, some of its features are similar to those found in other major design specifications around the world, including the Eurocodes, the Australian standard, the Canadian standard, and ACI 318 (ACI, 2019).

The direct analysis method allows a more accurate determination of the load effects in the structure through the inclusion of the effects of geometric imperfections and stiffness reductions directly within the structural analysis. This also allows the use of K=1.0 in calculating the in-plane column strength,  $ P_{c} $ , within the beam-column interaction equations of Chapter H. This is a significant simplification in the design of steel moment frames and combined systems. Verification studies for the direct analysis method are provided by Deierlein et al. (2002), Maleck and White (2003), and Martinez-Garcia and Ziemian (2006).

### 1. General Analysis Requirements

Deformations to be Considered in the Analysis. It is required that the analysis consider flexural, shear, and axial deformations, and all other component and connection deformations that contribute to the displacement of the structure. However, it is important to note that "consider" is not synonymous with "include," and some deformations can be neglected after rational consideration of their likely effect. For example, the in-plane deformation of a concrete-on-steel deck floor diaphragm in an office building usually can be neglected, but that of a cold-formed steel roof deck in a large warehouse with widely spaced lateral force-resisting elements usually cannot. As another example, shear deformations in beams and columns in a low-rise moment frame usually can be neglected, but this may not be true in a high-rise framed-tube system with relatively deep members and short spans. For such frames, the use of rigid offsets to account for member depths may significantly overestimate frame stiffness and consequently underestimate second-order effects due to high shear stresses within the panel zone of the connections. For example, Charney and Johnson (1986) found that for the range of columns and beam sizes they studied, the deflections of a subassembly modeled using centerline dimensions could vary from an overestimation of 23% to an underestimation of 20% when compared to a finite element model. Charney and Johnson conclude that analysis based on centerline dimensions may either underestimate or overestimate drift, with results depending on the span of the girder and on the web thickness of the column.

Second-Order Effects. The direct analysis method includes the basic requirement to calculate the internal load effects using a second-order analysis that accounts for both  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects (see Figure C-C2.1).  $ P-\Delta $  effects are the effects of loads acting on the displaced location of joints or member-end nodes in a structure.  $ P-\delta $  effects are the effect of loads acting on the deflected shape of a member between joints or member-end nodes.

Many, but not all, modern commercial structural analysis programs are capable of accurately and directly modeling all significant  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  second-order effects. Programs that accurately estimate second-order effects typically solve the governing differential equations either through the use of a geometric stiffness approach (McGuire et al., 2000; Ziemian, 2010) or the use of stability functions (Chen and Lui, 1987). What is, and just as importantly what is not, included in the analysis should be verified by the user for each particular program. Some programs neglect  $ P-\delta $  effects in the analysis of the structure, and because this is a common approximation that is permitted under certain conditions, it is discussed at the end of this section.

Methods that modify first-order analysis results through second-order multipliers are permitted. The use of the  $ B_{1} $  and  $ B_{2} $  multipliers provided in Appendix 8 is one such method. The accuracy of other methods should be verified.

Analysis Benchmark Problems. The following benchmark problems are recommended as a first-level check to determine whether an analysis procedure meets the requirements of a  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  second-order analysis adequate for use in the direct analysis method (and the effective length method in Appendix 7). Some second-order analysis procedures may not include the effects of  $ P-\delta $  on the overall response of the structure. These benchmark problems are intended to reveal whether or not these effects are included in the analysis. It should be noted that in accordance with the requirements of Section C2.1(b), it is not always necessary to include  $ P-\delta $  effects in the second-order analysis (additional discussion of the consequences of neglecting these effects will follow).

The benchmark problem descriptions and solutions are shown in Figures C-C2.2 and C-C2.3. Proportional loading is assumed and axial, flexural, and shear deformations are included. Case 1 is a simply supported beam-column subjected to an axial load concurrent with a uniformly distributed transverse load between supports. This problem contains only  $ P-\delta $  effects because there is no translation of one end of the member relative to the other. Case 2 is a fixed-base cantilevered beam-column subjected to an axial load concurrent with a lateral load at its top. This problem contains both  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects. In confirming the accuracy of the analysis method, both moments and deflections should be checked at the locations shown for the various levels of axial load on the member and in all cases should agree within 3% and 5%, respectively.

Given that there are many attributes that must be studied to confirm the accuracy of a given analysis method for routine use in the design of general framing systems, a wide range of benchmark problems should be employed. Several other targeted analysis benchmark problems can be found in White et al. (2021), Chen and Lui (1987), and McGuire et al. (2000). When using benchmark problems to assess the correctness of a second-order procedure, the details of the analysis used in the benchmark study, such as the number of elements used to represent the member and the numerical solution scheme employed, should be replicated in the analysis used to design the actual structure. Because the ratio of design load to elastic buckling load is a strong indicator of the influence of second-order effects, benchmark problems with such ratios on the order of 0.6 to 0.7 should be included.

Effect of Neglecting P- $ \delta $ . A common type of approximate analysis is one that captures only  $ P-\Delta $  effects due to member end translations (for example, interstory drift) but fails to capture  $ P-\delta $  effects due to curvature of the member relative to its chord. This type of analysis is referred to as a  $ P-\Delta $  analysis. Where  $ P-\delta $  effects are significant, errors arise in approximate methods that do not accurately account for the effect of  $ P-\delta $  moments on amplification of both local ( $ \delta $ ) and global ( $ \Delta $ ) displacements, and corresponding internal moments. These errors can occur both with second-order computer analysis programs and with the  $ B_{1} $  and  $ B_{2} $  amplifiers. For instance, the  $ R_{M} $  modifier in Equation A-8-7 is an adjustment factor that approximates the effects of  $ P-\delta $  (due to column curvature) on the overall sideway displacements,  $ \Delta $ , and the corresponding moments. For regular rectangular moment frames, a single-element-per-member  $ P-\Delta $  analysis is equivalent to using the  $ B_{2} $  amplifier of Equation A-8-6 with  $ R_{M}=1 $ , and hence, such an analysis neglects the effect of  $ P-\delta $  on the response of the structure.

Section C2.1(b) indicates that a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis (one that neglects the effect of  $ P-\delta $  deformations on the response of the structure) is permissible for typical building structures when the ratio of second-order drift to first-order drift is less than 1.7 and no more than one-third of the total gravity load on the building is on columns that are part of moment-resisting frames. The latter condition is equivalent to an  $ R_{M} $  value of 0.95 or greater. When these conditions are satisfied, the error in lateral displacement from a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis typically will be less than 3%. However, when the  $ P-\delta $  effect in one or more members is large (corresponding to a  $ B_{1} $  multiplier of more than about 1.2), use of a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis may lead to larger errors in the nonsway moments in components connected to the high- $ P-\delta $  members.

The engineer should be aware of this possible error before using a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis in such cases. For example, consider the evaluation of the fixed-base cantilevered beam-column shown in Figure C-C2.4 using the direct analysis method. The side-sway displacement amplification factor is 3.83 and the base moment amplifier is 3.32, giving  $ M_{u}=1,390 $  kip-in.  $ (157\times10^{6} $  N-mm).

For the loads shown, the beam-column strength interaction according to Equation H1-1a is equal to 1.0. The sideway displacement and base moment amplification determined by a single-element  $ P-\Delta $  analysis, which ignores the effect of  $ P-\delta $  on the response of the structure, is 2.55, resulting in an estimated  $ M_{u}=1,070 $  kip-in.  $ (121\times10^{6} $  N-mm) $ — $ an error of 23.2% relative to the more accurate value of  $ M_{u} $ —and a beam-column interaction value of 0.91.

 $ P-\delta $  effects can be captured in some (but not all)  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis methods by subdividing the members into multiple elements. For this example, three equal-length  $ P-\Delta $  analysis elements are required to reduce the errors in the second-order base moment and sideway displacement to less than 3% and 5%, respectively.

It should be noted that, in this case, the unconservative error that results from ignoring the effect of  $ P-\delta $  on the response of the structure is removed through the use of Equation A-8-8. For the loads shown in Figure C-C2.4, Equations A-8-6 and A-8-7 with  $ R_{M}=0.85 $  give a  $ B_{2} $  amplifier of 3.52. This corresponds to  $ M_{u}=1,480 $  kip-in.  $ (170\times10^{6} $  N-mm) in the preceding example; approximately 6% over that determined from a computational second-order analysis that includes both  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects.

For sway columns with nominally simply supported base conditions, the errors in the second-order internal moment and in the second-order displacements from a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis are generally smaller than 3% and 5%, respectively, when  $ \alpha P_{r}/P_{eL} \leq 0.05 $ .

For sway columns with rotational restraint at both ends of at least  $ 1.5(EI/L) $  if the analysis uses nominal stiffness, or  $ 1.5(0.8\tau_{b}EI/L) $  if the analysis uses a flexural stiffness reduction of  $ 0.8\tau_{b} $ , the errors in the second-order internal moments and displacements from a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis are generally smaller than 3% and 5%, respectively, when  $ \alpha P_{r}/P_{eL} \leq 0.12 $ .

For members subjected predominantly to nonsway end conditions, the errors in the second-order internal moments and displacements from a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis are generally smaller than 3% and 5%, respectively, when  $ \alpha P_{r}/P_{eL} \leq 0.05 $ .

In meeting these limitations for use of a  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis, it is important to note that in accordance with Section C2.1(b) the moments along the length of the member (in other words, the moments between the member-end nodal locations) should be amplified as necessary to include  $ P-\delta $  effects. One device for achieving this is the use of a  $ B_{1} $  factor.

White et al. (2021) provide further guidelines for the appropriate number of  $ P-\Delta $  analysis elements in cases where the  $ P-\Delta $ -only analysis limits are exceeded, as well as guidelines for calculating internal element second-order moments. They also provide relaxed guidelines for the number of elements required per member when using typical second-order analysis capabilities that include both  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects.

As previously indicated, the engineer should verify the accuracy of second-order analysis software by comparisons to known solutions for a range of representative loadings. In addition to the examples presented in Chen and Lui (1987) and McGuire et al. (2000), White et al. (2021) provides five useful benchmark problems for testing second-order analysis of frames composed of prismatic members. In addition, they provide benchmarks for evaluation of second-order analysis capabilities for web-tapered members.

Analysis with Factored Loads. It is essential that the analysis of the system be made with loads factored to the strength limit state level because of the nonlinearity associated with second-order effects. For design by ASD, this load level is estimated as 1.6 times the ASD load combinations, and the analysis must be conducted at this elevated load to capture second-order effects at the strength level.

Because second-order effects are dependent on the ratios of applied loads and member forces to structural and member stiffnesses, equivalent results may be obtained by using 1.0 times ASD load combinations if all stiffnesses are reduced by a factor of 1.6, in other words, using 0.5E instead of 0.8E in the second-order analysis (note that the use of 0.5E is similar to the 12/23 factor used in the definition of  $ F_{e}^{\prime} $  in earlier ASD Specifications). With this approach, required member strengths are provided directly by the analysis and do not have to be divided by 1.6 when evaluating member capacities using ASD. Notional loads,  $ N_{i} $ , would also be defined using 1.0 times ASD load combinations, in other words,  $ \alpha = 1.0 $ .  $ \tau_{b} $  would be redefined as  $ \tau_{b} = 1.0 $  when  $ P_{r}/P_{ns} \leq 0.3 $  and  $ \tau_{b} = 4(P_{r}/0.6P_{ns})(1 - P_{r}/0.6P_{ns}) $  when  $ P_{r}/P_{ns} > 0.3 $ . The stiffness of components comprised of other materials should be evaluated at design loads and reduced by the same 1.6 factor, although this may be overly conservative if these stiffnesses already include  $ \phi $ -factors. Serviceability criteria may be assessed using 50% of the deflections from this analysis, although this will overestimate second-order effects at service loads.

### 2. Consideration of Initial System Imperfections

Current stability design provisions are based on the premise that the member forces are calculated by second-order elastic analysis, where equilibrium is satisfied on the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_18.md -->

deformed geometry of the structure. Initial imperfections in the structure, such as out-of-plumbness and material and fabrication tolerances, create additional destabilizing effects.

In the development and calibration of the direct analysis method, initial geometric imperfections were conservatively assumed equal to the maximum material, fabrication, and erection tolerances permitted in the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (AISC, 2005a), which at the time included a member out-of-straightness equal to L/1,000, where L is the member length between brace or framing points, and a frame out-of-plumbness equal to H/500, where H is the story height. Although the L/1,000 requirement on member out-of-straightness is no longer specified in the current Code of Standard Practice (AISC, 2022a), it continues to be specified in applicable ASTM material standards. The permitted out-of-plumbness may be smaller in some cases, as specified in the Code of Standard Practice.

Initial imperfections may be accounted for in the direct analysis method through direct modeling (Section C2.2a) or the inclusion of notional loads (Section C2.2b). When second-order effects are such that the maximum sideway amplification,  $ \Delta_{2nd-order}/\Delta_{1st-order} $  or  $ B_{2} \leq 1.7 $  using the reduced elastic stiffness (or 1.5 using the unreduced elastic stiffness) for all lateral load combinations, it is permitted to apply notional loads only in gravity load-only combinations and not in combination with other lateral loads. At this low range of sideway amplification or  $ B_{2} $ , the errors in internal forces caused by not applying the notional loads in combination with other lateral loads are relatively small. When  $ B_{2} $  is above this threshold, notional loads must also be applied in combination with other lateral loads.

Appendix 1, Section 1.2, includes an extension to the direct analysis method that permits direct modeling of initial imperfections along the lengths of members (member imperfections) as well as at member ends (system imperfections). This extension permits axially loaded members (columns and beam-columns according to Chapters E and H, respectively) to be designed by employing a nominal compressive strength that is taken as the cross-sectional strength; this is equivalent to the use of an effective member length,  $ L_{c} = 0 $ , when computing the nominal compressive strength,  $ P_{n} $ , of compression members.

The Specification requirements for consideration of initial imperfections are intended to apply only to analyses for strength limit states. It is not necessary, in most cases, to consider initial imperfections in analyses for serviceability conditions such as drift, deflection, and vibration.

### 3. Adjustments to Stiffness

Partial yielding accentuated by residual stresses in members can produce a general softening of the structure at the strength limit state that further creates additional destabilizing effects. The direct analysis method is also calibrated against inelastic distributed-plasticity analyses that account for the spread of plasticity through the member cross section and along the member length. In these calibration studies, residual stresses in wide-flange shapes were assumed to have a maximum value of  $ 0.3F_{y} $  in compression at the flange tips, and a distribution matching the so-called

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_19.md -->

Lehigh pattern—a linear variation across the flanges and uniform tension in the web (Ziemian, 2010).

Reduced stiffness  $ (EI^{*}=0.8\tau_{b}EI $  and  $ EA^{*}=0.8\tau_{b}EA) $  is used in the direct analysis method for two reasons. First, for frames with slender members, where the limit state is governed by elastic stability, the 0.8 factor on stiffness results in a system available strength equal to 0.8 times the elastic stability limit. This is roughly equivalent to the margin of safety implied in the design provisions for slender columns by the effective length procedure where, from Equation E3-3,  $ \phi P_{n}=0.90(0.877P_{e})=0.79P_{e} $ . Second, for frames with intermediate or stocky columns, the  $ 0.8\tau_{b} $  factor reduces the stiffness to account for inelastic softening prior to the members reaching their design strength. The  $ \tau_{b} $  factor is similar to the inelastic stiffness reduction factor implied in the column curve to account for loss of stiffness under high compression loads  $ (\alpha P_{r}>0.5P_{ns}) $ , and the 0.8 factor accounts for additional softening under combined axial compression and bending. It is a fortuitous coincidence that the reduction coefficients for both slender and stocky columns are close enough, such that the single reduction factor of  $ 0.8\tau_{b} $  works over the full range of slenderness. For the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016), the definition for  $ \tau_{b} $  was modified to account for the effects of local buckling of slender elements in compression members.

The use of reduced stiffness only pertains to analyses for strength and stability limit states. It does not apply to analyses for other stiffness-based conditions and criteria, such as for drift, deflection, vibration, and period determination.

For ease of application in design practice, where  $ \tau_{b}=1 $ , the reduction on EI and EA can be applied by modifying E in the analysis. However, for computer programs that do semi-automated design, one should confirm that the reduced E is applied only for the second-order analysis. The elastic modulus should not be reduced in nominal strength equations that include E (for example,  $ M_{n} $  for lateral-torsional buckling in an unbraced beam).

As shown in Figure C-C2.5, the net effect of modifying the analysis in the manner just described is to amplify the second-order forces such that they are closer to the actual internal forces in the structure. It is for this reason that the beam-column interaction for in-plane flexural buckling is checked using an axial strength,  $ P_{nL} $ , calculated from the column curve using the actual unbraced member length,  $ L_{c} = L $ , in other words, with K = 1.0.

In cases where the flexibility of other structural components (connections, column base details, horizontal trusses acting as diaphragms) is modeled explicitly in the analysis, the stiffness of these components also should be reduced. The stiffness reduction may be taken conservatively as  $ EA^{*}=0.8EA $  and  $ EI^{*}=0.8EI $  for all cases. Surovek et al. (2005) discusses the appropriate reduction of connection stiffness in the analysis of partially restrained frames.

Where concrete or masonry shear walls or other nonsteel components contribute to the stability of the structure and the governing codes or standards for those elements specify a greater stiffness reduction, the greater reduction should be applied.

### C3. CALCULATION OF AVAILABLE STRENGTHS

Section C3 provides that when the analysis meets the requirements in Section C2, the member provisions for available strength in Chapters D through I and connection provisions in Chapters J and K complete the process of design by the direct analysis method. The effective length for flexural buckling may be taken as the unbraced length for all members in the strength checks.

Where beams and columns rely upon braces that are not part of the lateral force-resisting system to define their unbraced length, the braces themselves must have sufficient strength and stiffness to control member movement at the brace points (see Appendix 6). Design requirements for braces that are part of the lateral force-resisting system (that is, braces that are included within the analysis of the structure) are included within Chapter C.

For beam-columns in single-axis flexure and compression, the analysis results from the direct analysis method may be used directly with the interaction equations in Section H1.3, which address in-plane flexural buckling and out-of-plane lateral-torsional instability separately. These separated interaction equations reduce the conservatism of the Section H1.1 provisions, which combine the two limit state checks into one equation that uses the most severe combination of in-plane and out-of-plane limits for  $ P_{r}/P_{c} $  and  $ M_{r}/M_{c} $ . A significant advantage of the direct analysis method is that the in-plane check with  $ P_{c} $  in the interaction equation is determined using the unbraced length of the member as its effective length.

# CHAPTER D DESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR TENSION

Chapter D includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Table D3.1, Cases 5 and 6, for round and rectangular HSS have been revised to include provisions for longitudinally loaded welds whose length is less than the distance between the welds and to improve accuracy.

(2) Section D5 has been revised to permit pin-connected members with pins 3 in. in diameter or larger to use an increased hole size.

The provisions of Chapter D do not account for eccentricities between the lines of action of connected assemblies.

### D1. SLENDERNESS LIMITATIONS

The advisory upper limit on slenderness, L/r, of 300 in the User Note is based on professional judgment and practical considerations of economics, serviceability, ease of handling, and care for the integrity of the member. Slender members are more susceptible to inadvertent damage during fabrication, transport, and erection. This damage could have a detrimental impact on member capacity, although less so for tension members than for compression members because out-of-straightness within reasonable tolerances does not affect the strength of tension members; applied tension tends to reduce, whereas compression tends to amplify, out-of-straightness. Note that rods may be less susceptible to these problems and so are excluded from the recommendation. Slender members may exhibit noisy vibrations when subjected to wind forces as in an open truss or when supporting vibrating equipment such as fans or compressors, and under even minor wind or seismic loading may result in "slapping" with cyclic buckling. Very slender members may sag excessively under self-weight. This sag would not affect the tensile strength of the member. However, the sagging appearance of such members may be aesthetically unacceptable if they are part of an open structure. The sagging of very slender brace members used in a tension-only braced frame may prevent the member from immediately engaging in tension, resulting in larger than predicted lateral drift levels and potential frame stability concerns.

For these reasons, it may be advantageous to specify members with slenderness ratios not exceeding this limit. The User Note references fabricated length. If tension members are spliced in the field, it is possible that the installed length may be greater than the fabricated length. In all cases, engineering judgment should be used to determine whether to apply the limit; if not, steps must be taken to eliminate the serviceability problems, and special care should be exercised by the fabricator and erector to protect the structural integrity of the member. Conformance to the maximum slenderness limit of 300 does not guarantee that these detrimental conditions

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_23.md -->

will not occur, but experience has shown that they can be significantly mitigated by conforming to this limit. For single angles, the radius of gyration about the z-axis produces the maximum L/r and, except for very unusual support conditions, the maximum effective slenderness ratio.

### D2. TENSILE STRENGTH

Because of strain hardening, a ductile steel bar loaded in axial tension can resist, without rupture, a force greater than the product of its gross area and its specified minimum yield stress. However, excessive elongation of a tension member due to uncontrolled yielding of its gross area not only marks the limit of its usefulness but can precipitate failure of the structural system of which it is a part. On the other hand, depending upon the reduction of area and other mechanical properties of the steel, the member can fail by rupture of the net area at a load smaller than required to yield the gross area. Hence, general yielding of the gross area and rupture of the net area both constitute limit states.

The length of the member in the net area is generally negligible relative to the total length of the member. Strain hardening is easily reached in the vicinity of bolt holes and yielding of the net area at these holes does not constitute a limit state of practical significance.

Except for HSS that are subjected to cyclic load reversals, there is no information that the factors governing the strength of HSS in tension differ from those for other structural shapes, and the provisions in Section D2 apply.

### D3. EFFECTIVE NET AREA

This section deals with the effect of shear lag, applicable to both welded and bolted tension members. Shear lag is a concept used to account for uneven stress distribution in connected members where some but not all of their elements (flange, web, leg, etc.) are connected. The reduction coefficient, U, is applied to the net area,  $ A_{n} $ , of bolted members and to the gross area,  $ A_{g} $ , of welded members. As the length of the connection, l, is increased, the shear lag effect diminishes. This concept is expressed empirically by the equation for U. Using this expression to compute the effective area, the estimated strength of some 1,000 bolted and riveted connection test specimens, with few exceptions, correlated with observed test results within a scatter band of  $ \pm10\% $  (Munse and Chesson, 1963). Subsequent research provides further justification for the current provisions (Easterling and Gonzales, 1993).

For any given profile and configuration of connected elements,  $ \overline{x} $  is the perpendicular distance from the connection plane, or face of the member, to the centroid of the member section resisting the connection force, as shown in Figure C-D3.1. The length, l, used in Table D3.1, is a function of the number of rows of fasteners or the length of weld. The length, l, is illustrated as the distance, parallel to the line of force, between the first and last row of fasteners in a line for bolted connections. The number of bolts in a line, for the purpose of the determination of l, is determined by the line with the maximum number of bolts in the connection. For staggered bolts, the out-to-out dimension is used for l, as shown in Figure C-D3.2.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_14/doc_24.md -->

For tension members with connections similar to that shown in Figure C-D3.1, the distance from the force in the member to the shear plane of the connection must be determined. For the I-shaped member with bolts in the flanges as shown in Figure C-D3.1(a), the member is treated as two WT-shapes. Because the section shown is symmetric about the horizontal axis and that axis is also the plastic neutral axis, the first moment of the area above the plastic neutral axis is  $ Z_{x}/2 $ , where  $ Z_{x} $  is the

plastic section modulus of the entire section,  $ Z = \Sigma |A_{i} d_{i}| $ . The area above the plastic neutral axis is A/2; therefore, by definition  $ \overline{x}_{l} = Z_{x}/A $ . Thus, for use in calculating U,  $ \overline{x}_{l} = d/2 - Z_{x}/A $ . For the I-shaped member with bolts in the web as shown in Figure C-D3.1(c), the shape is treated as two channels and the shear plane is assumed to be at the web centerline. Using the definitions just discussed, but related now to the y-axis, yields  $ \overline{x} = Z_{y}/A $ . Note that the plastic neutral axis must be an axis of symmetry for this relationship to apply. Thus, it cannot be used for the case shown in Figure C-D3.1(b) where  $ \overline{x} $  would simply be determined from the properties of a channel.

There is insufficient data for establishing a value of U if all lines have only one bolt, but it is probably conservative to use  $ A_{e} $  equal to the net area of the connected element. The limit states of block shear (Section J4.3) and bearing and tearout (Section J3.11), which must be checked, will probably control the design. Historically, the minimum length of welds in end connections has not been less than the perpendicular distance between the welds. This practice dates to the 1946 AISC Specification (AISC, 1946). Though no longer a requirement, this practice is still reasonable.

The ratio of the area of the connected element to the gross area is a reasonable lower bound for U and allows for cases where the calculated U based on  $ (1-\overline{x}/l) $  is very small or nonexistent, such as when a single bolt per gage line is used and l=0.

The effect of connection eccentricity is a function of connection and member stiffness and may sometimes need to be considered in the design of the tension connection or member. Historically, engineers have neglected the effect of eccentricity in both the member and the connection when designing tension-only bracing. In Cases 1a and 1b shown in Figure C-D3.3, the length of the connection required to resist the axial loads will usually reduce the applied axial load on the bolts to a negligible value. For Case 2, the flexibility of the member and the connections will allow the member to deform such that the resulting eccentricity is relieved to a considerable extent.

For welded connections, l is the length of the weld parallel to the line of force as shown in Figure C-D3.4 for longitudinal and longitudinal plus transverse welds. For welds with unequal lengths, use the average length.

End connections for HSS in tension are commonly made by welding around the perimeter of the HSS; in this case, there is no shear lag or reduction in the gross area. Alternatively, an end connection with gusset plates can be used. Single gusset plates may be welded in longitudinal slots that are located at the centerline of the cross section. Welding around the end of the gusset plate may be omitted for statically loaded connections to prevent possible undercutting of the gusset and having to bridge the gap at the end of the slot. In such cases, the net area at the end of the slot is the critical area as illustrated in Figure C-D3.5. Alternatively, a pair of gusset plates can be welded to opposite sides of a rectangular HSS with flare bevel groove welds with no reduction in the gross area.

The shear lag factors given in Cases 7 and 8 of Table D3.1 are given as alternate U values to the value determined from  $ (1-\bar{x}/l) $  given for Case 2 in Table D3.1. It is permissible to use the larger of the two values.

### D4. BUILT-UP MEMBERS

Although not commonly used, built-up member configurations using lacing, tie plates, and perforated cover plates are permitted by this Specification. The length and thickness of tie plates are limited by the distance between the lines of fasteners, which may be either bolts or welds.

### D5. PIN-CONNECTED MEMBERS

Pin-connected members are occasionally used as tension members with very large dead loads. Pin-connected members are not recommended when there is sufficient variation in live loading to cause wearing of the pins in the holes. The dimensional requirements presented in Section D5.2 must be met to provide for the proper functioning of the pin.

### 1. Tensile Strength

The tensile strength requirements for pin-connected members use the same  $ \phi $  and  $ \Omega $  values as elsewhere in this Specification for similar limit states. However, the definitions of effective net area for tension and shear are different.

### 2. Dimensional Requirements

The capacity of pin-connected members and their connections involve complex stress distributions and various failure modes. Dimensional limitations have been imposed on these members to limit the modes that must be checked. In the past, these dimensional limitations limited the diameter of the pin hole to no more than  $ \frac{1}{32} $  in. (1 mm) larger than the diameter of the pin when the member is expected to provide for relative movement of the connected part under full load. This small clearance can lead to erection and other issues, especially with larger diameter pins. Duerr (2006) summarized the theory and results of past test programs on pin-connected members. Based on this research, a 3-in.-(75-mm-) diameter pin utilizing a  $ \frac{1}{16} $ -in.-(2-mm-) diameter oversized hole and a reduction factor,  $ C_{r}=0.95 $ , would be a conservative design. Larger pins with the same clearance would have a  $ C_{r} $  value approaching 1.0. A pin hole oversize of  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) is allowed for pins with a diameter of 3 in. (75 mm) or larger to ease clearance issues, provided the design values are multiplied by 0.95 to account for the worst case of this correction factor. Pins larger than 3 in. (75 mm) in diameter with this  $ \frac{1}{16} $ -in.-(2-mm-) diameter hole clearance would theoretically require less of an adjustment to their capacity, but that level of precision is not included currently in this Specification. Hole diameters larger than pin diameter plus  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) are not currently allowed due to the implications of additional structural movement that could occur because of the increased hole size and the absence of clamping force from the pin connection—unlike what would exist with a bolted connection. The engineer of record should determine if the additional clearance would negatively impact the structural design.

Dimensional requirements for pin-connected members are illustrated in Figure C-D5.1.

### D6. EYEBARS

Forged eyebars have generally been replaced by pin-connected plates or eyebars thermally cut from plates. Provisions for the proportioning of eyebars contained in this Specification are based upon standards evolved from long experience with

forged eyebars. Through extensive destructive testing, eyebars have been found to provide balanced designs when they are thermally cut instead of forged. The more conservative rules for pin-connected members of nonuniform cross section and for members not having enlarged "circular" heads are likewise based on the results of experimental research (Johnston, 1939).

Stockier proportions are required for eyebars fabricated from steel having a specified minimum yield stress greater than 70 ksi (485 MPa) to eliminate any possibility of their “dishing” under the higher design stress.

### 1. Tensile Strength

The tensile strength of eyebars is determined as for general tension members, except that, for calculation purposes, the width of the body of the eyebar is limited to eight times its thickness.

### 2. Dimensional Requirements

Dimensional limitations for eyebars are illustrated in Figure C-D6.1. Adherence to these limits assures that the controlling limit state will be tensile yielding of the body; thus, additional limit state checks are unnecessary.

# CHAPTER E DESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR COMPRESSION

Chapter E includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification.

(1) Throughout this chapter the variable  $ F_{cr} $  has been changed to  $ F_{n} $  to better reflect its correct meaning as the nominal stress.

(2) Provisions have been added to Section E4 to address lateral bracing that is offset from the shear center.

### E1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

The column equations in Section E3 are based on a conversion of research data into strength equations (Ziemian, 2010; Tide, 1985, 2001). These equations are the same as those that have been used since the 2005 AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2005b) and are essentially the same as those created for the initial AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986). The resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , was increased from 0.85 to 0.90 in the 2005 AISC Specification, recognizing substantial numbers of additional column strength analyses and test results, combined with the changes in industry practice that had taken place since the original calibrations were performed in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the original research on the probability-based strength of steel columns (Bjorhovde, 1972, 1978, 1988), three column curves were recommended. The three column curves were the approximate means of bands of strength curves for columns of similar manufacture, based on extensive analyses and confirmed by full-scale tests (Bjorhovde, 1972). For example, hot-formed and cold-formed heat treated HSS columns fell into the data band of highest strength [SSRC Column Category 1P (Bjorhovde, 1972, 1988; Bjorhovde and Birkemoe, 1979; Ziemian, 2010)], while welded built-up wide-flange columns made from universal mill plates were included in the data band of lowest strength (SSRC Column Category 3P). The largest group of data clustered around SSRC Column Category 2P. Had the original LRFD Specification opted for using all three column curves for the respective column categories, probabilistic analysis would have resulted in a resistance factor,  $ \phi = 0.90 $  or even slightly higher (Galambos, 1983; Bjorhovde, 1988; Ziemian, 2010). However, it was decided to use only one column curve, SSRC Column Category 2P, for all column types. This resulted in a larger data spread and a larger coefficient of variation; therefore, a resistance factor,  $ \phi = 0.85 $ , was adopted for the column equations to achieve a level of reliability comparable to that of beams (AISC, 1986). Because the selected column strength curve was based on tests of actual columns, the out-of-straightness tolerances permitted in the applicable material standards were met. If those tolerances are exceeded, appropriate strength reductions must be made. Since then, a number of changes in industry practice have taken place: (a) welded built-up shapes are no longer manufactured from universal mill plates; (b) the most

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_1.md -->

commonly used structural steel is now ASTM A992/A992M, with a specified minimum yield stress of 50 ksi (345 MPa); and (c) changes in steelmaking practice have resulted in materials of higher quality and much better-defined properties. The level and variability of the yield stress thus have led to a reduced coefficient of variation for the relevant material properties (Bartlett et al., 2003).

An examination of the SSRC Column Curve Selection Table (Bjorhovde, 1988; Ziemian, 2010) shows that the SSRC 3P Column Curve Category is no longer needed. It is now possible to use only the statistical data for SSRC Column Category 2P for the probabilistic determination of the reliability of columns. The curves in Figures C-E1.1 and C-E1.2 show the variation of the reliability index,  $ \beta $ , with the live-to-dead load ratio, L/D, in the range of 1 to 5 for LRFD with  $ \phi = 0.90 $  and ASD with  $ \Omega = 1.67 $ , respectively, for  $ F_{y} = 50 $  ksi (345 MPa). The reliability index does not fall below  $ \beta = 2.6 $ . This is comparable to the reliability of beams.

For this edition of the Specification, the results of the column strength curves have been changed from  $ F_{cr} $  to  $ F_{n} $ . Previous editions of this Specification have not been consistent with the use of  $ F_{cr} $  and  $ F_{e} $  across Chapters E and F. Sometimes  $ F_{cr} $  was the result of applying a strength curve, such as what was common here in Chapter E with equations, such as Equation E3-2. Sometimes  $ F_{cr} $  was actually the elastic buckling stress, as is still common in Chapter F. Thus, to establish a clear designation for output from a strength curve in this chapter,  $ F_{cr} $  is replaced by  $ F_{n} $ .

### E2. EFFECTIVE LENGTH

In the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016), the effective length, which since the 1963 AISC Specification (AISC, 1963) had been given as KL, was changed to  $ L_{c} $ . This was done to simplify the definition of effective length for the various modes of buckling without having to define a specific effective length factor, K. The effective

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_15_img_in_chart_box_185_811_673_1173.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-E1.1. Reliability of columns (LRFD).</div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, August 1, 2022 AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_2.md -->

length is then defined as KL in those situations where effective length factors, K, are appropriate. This change recognized that there are several ways to determine the effective length that do not involve the direct determination of an effective length factor. It also recognized that for some modes of buckling, such as torsional and flexural-torsional buckling, the traditional use of K is not the best approach. The direct use of effective length without the K-factor can be seen as a return to the approach used in the 1961 AISC Specification (AISC, 1961), when column strength equations based on effective length were first introduced by AISC.

The concept of a maximum limiting slenderness ratio has experienced an evolutionary change from a mandatory “…The slenderness ratio,  $ KL/r $ , of compression members shall not exceed 200…” in the 1978 AISC Specification (AISC, 1978) to no restriction at all in the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b). The 1978 ASD and the 1999 LRFD Specifications (AISC, 2000b) provided a transition from the mandatory limit to a limit that was defined in the 2005 AISC Specification by a User Note, with the observation that “…the slenderness ratio,  $ KL/r $ , preferably should not exceed 200…” However, the designer should keep in mind that compression members with a slenderness ratio of more than 200 will have a drastically reduced capacity, with nominal stress,  $ F_{n} $ , (Equation E3-3) less than 6.3 ksi (43 MPa). Although not strictly a design requirement, the advisory upper limit on slenderness ratio provides a minimum compressive strength.

A compression member with a high slenderness ratio may deflect due to its self-weight and lead to aesthetic, stability, or serviceability concerns. For example, exposed slender brace members may exhibit unsightly sagging due to member self-weight. Sagging will produce flexural stresses and, thus, reduce the available compressive strength. An upper limit on member slenderness, based on professional judgment and practical considerations of economics, further eases handling and minimizes inadvertent damage during fabrication, transport, and erection. Even minor

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_15_img_in_chart_box_185_798_673_1160.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-E1.2. Reliability of columns (ASD).</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_3.md -->

damage in slender compression members could reduce the already limited capacity and potentially result in failure at loads less than those considered in design. Slender members may exhibit noisy vibrations when subjected to wind forces, as in an open truss or when supporting vibrating equipment such as fans or compressors, and under even minor wind or seismic loading may result in "slapping" with cyclic buckling. The advisory upper limit of 300 for the slenderness ratio is based on the fabricated length of the member and the minimum radius of gyration of the section. Columns in building structures, for example, are often fabricated in multi-story lengths. For these reasons, it may be advantageous to specify members not exceeding the limit of 300. Engineering judgment should be used to determine whether or not to apply the limit; if not, steps must be taken to eliminate the serviceability problems, and special care should be exercised by the fabricator and erector to protect the structural integrity of the member.

Conformance with these limits does not guarantee that these detrimental conditions will not occur, but experience has shown that they can be significantly mitigated by conforming to these limits. For single angles, the radius of gyration about the z-axis produces the maximum L/r and, except for very unusual support conditions, the maximum effective slenderness ratio.

### E3. FLEXURAL BUCKLING OF MEMBERS WITHOUT SLENDER ELEMENTS

Section E3 applies to compression members with all nonslender elements, as defined in Section B4.

The column strength equations in Section E3 are the same as those in the previous editions of the LRFD Specification, with the exception of the cosmetic replacement of the slenderness term,  $ \lambda_{c} = \left( KL/\pi r \right) \sqrt{F_{y}/E} $ , by the more familiar slenderness ratio, KL/r, for 2005 and 2010, and by the simpler form of the slenderness ratio,  $ L_{c}/r $ , since 2016. For the convenience of those calculating the elastic buckling stress,  $ F_{e} $ , directly, without first calculating an effective length, the limits on the use of Equations E3-2 and E3-3 are also provided in terms of the ratio  $ F_{y}/F_{e} $ , as shown in the following discussion.

Comparisons between the previous column design curves and those introduced in the 2005 AISC Specification and continued in this Specification are shown in Figures C-E3.1 and C-E3.2 for the case of  $ F_{y}=50 $  ksi (345 MPa). The curves show the variation of the available column strength with the slenderness ratio for LRFD and ASD, respectively. The LRFD curves reflect the change of the resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , from 0.85 to 0.90, as was explained in Commentary Section E1. These column equations provide improved economy in comparison with the editions of the Specification prior to 2005.

The limit between elastic and inelastic buckling is defined to be  $ L_{c}/r = 4.71\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  or  $ F_{y}/F_{e} = 2.25 $ . These are the same as  $ F_{e} = 0.44F_{y} $  that was used in the 2005 AISC Specification. For convenience, these limits are defined in Table C-E3.1 for the common values of  $ F_{y} $ .

One of the key parameters in the column strength equations is the elastic critical stress,  $ F_{e} $ . Equation E3-4 presents the familiar Euler form for  $ F_{e} $ . However,  $ F_{e} $  can also be determined by other means, including a direct frame buckling analysis or a torsional or flexural-torsional buckling analysis as addressed in Section E4.

The column strength equations of Section E3 can also be used for frame buckling and for torsional or flexural-torsional buckling (Section E4). They may also be entered with a modified slenderness ratio for single-angle members (Section E5).

### E4. TORSIONAL AND FLEXURAL-TORSIONAL BUCKLING OF SINGLE ANGLES AND MEMBERS WITHOUT SLENDER ELEMENTS

Section E4 applies to singly symmetric and unsymmetric members and certain doubly symmetric members, such as cruciform or built-up columns with all nonslender elements, as defined in Section B4 for uniformly compressed elements. It also applies to doubly symmetric members when the torsional buckling length is greater than the flexural buckling length of the member. In addition, Section E4 applies to single angles with  $ b/t > 0.71\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , although there are no ASTM A36/A36M hot-rolled angles for which this applies; for angles with  $ F_{y} = 50 $  ksi (345 MPa) and greater, this section may apply.

The equations in Section E4 for determining the torsional and flexural-torsional elastic buckling loads of columns are derived in textbooks and monographs on structural stability (Bleich, 1952; Timoshenko and Gere, 1961; Galambos, 1968a; Chen and Atsuta, 1977; Galambos and Surovek, 2008; and Ziemian, 2010). Because these equations apply only to elastic buckling, they must be modified for inelastic buckling by the appropriate equations of Section E3. Inelasticity has a more significant impact on warping torsion than St. Venant torsion. For consideration of inelastic effects, the full elastic torsional or flexural-torsional buckling stress is conservatively used to determine  $ F_{e} $  for use in the column equations of Section E3.

Torsional buckling of symmetric shapes and flexural-torsional buckling of unsymmetrical shapes are failure modes usually not considered in the design of hot-rolled columns. They generally do not govern, or the critical load differs very little from the minor-axis flexural buckling load. Torsional and flexural-torsional buckling modes may, however, control the strength of symmetric columns manufactured from relatively thin plate elements and unsymmetric columns and symmetric columns having torsional unbraced lengths significantly larger than the minor-axis flexural unbraced lengths.

Equations for determining the elastic critical stress for columns are given in Section E4. Table C-E4.1 serves as a guide for selecting the appropriate equations. Equation E4-4 is the general buckling expression that is applicable to doubly symmetric, singly symmetric, and unsymmetric shapes. Equation E4-3 was derived from Equation E4-4 for the specific case of a singly symmetric shape in which the y-axis is the axis of symmetry (such as in WT sections). For members, such as channels, in which the x-axis is the axis of symmetry,  $ F_{ey} $  in Equation E4-3 should be replaced with  $ F_{ex} $ .

For doubly symmetric shapes, the geometric centroid and shear center coincide resulting in  $ x_{o}=y_{o}=0 $ . Therefore, for a doubly symmetric section, Equation E4-4

results in three roots: flexural buckling about the x-axis, flexural buckling about the y-axis, and torsional buckling about the shear center of the section, with the lowest root controlling the capacity of the cross section. Most designers are familiar with evaluating the strength of a wide-flange column by considering flexural buckling about the x-axis and y-axis; however, torsional buckling as given by Equation E4-2 is another potential buckling mode that should be considered and may control when the unbraced length for torsional buckling exceeds the unbraced length for minor-axis flexural buckling. Equation E4-2 is applicable for columns that twist about the shear center of the section, which will be the case when lateral bracing details like that shown in Figure C-E4.1 are used. The rod that is used for the brace in this case restrains the column from lateral movement about the minor axis, but does not generally prevent twist of the section and therefore the unbraced length for torsional

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_7.md -->

buckling may be larger than for minor-axis flexure, which is a case where torsional buckling may control. Most typical column base plate details will restrain twist at the base of the column. In addition, twist will often also be adequately restrained by relatively simple framing to beams. Many of the cases where inadequate torsional restraint is provided at a brace point will often occur at intermediate (between the ends of the column) brace locations.

Many common bracing details may result in situations where the lateral bracing is offset from the shear center of the section, such as columns or roof trusses restrained by a shear diaphragm that is connected to girts or purlins on the outside of the column or chord flange. Depending on the orientation of the primary member, the bracing may be offset along either the minor axis or the major axis as depicted in Figure C-E4.2. Because girts or purlins often have relatively simple connections, they do not restrain twist of the members; thus, columns or truss chords can be susceptible to a combination of torsional buckling and flexural buckling. In these cases, due to the offset of the bracing relative to the shear center, the members are susceptible to constrained-axis torsional buckling.

Timoshenko and Gere (1961) developed the following expressions for constrained-axis torsional buckling.

Bracing offset along the minor axis by an amount a [see Figure C-E4.2(a)] as follows:

 $$ F_{e}=\omega\Biggl[\frac{\pi^{2}EI_{y}}{\left(L_{cz}\right)^{2}}\Biggl(\frac{h_{o}^{2}}{4}+a^{2}\Biggr)+GJ\Biggr]\frac{1}{Ar_{o}^{2}} $$ 

Bracing offset along the major axis by an amount b [(see Figure C-E4.2(b)] as follows:

 $$ F_{e}=\omega\Biggl[\frac{\pi^{2}EI_{y}}{\left(L_{cz}\right)^{2}}\Biggl(\frac{h_{o}^{2}}{4}+\frac{I_{x}}{I_{y}}b^{2}\Biggr)+GJ\Biggr]\frac{1}{Ar_{o}^{2}} $$ 

where the polar radius of gyration is given by the following expression:

 $$ r_{o}^{2}=\left(r_{x}^{2}+r_{y}^{2}+a^{2}+b^{2}\right) $$ 

The terms in these equations are as defined in Section E4 with the exception of a, b, and  $ \omega $ . The bracing offsets, a and b, are measured relative to the shear center. These are taken as  $ y_{a} $  and  $ x_{a} $ , respectively, in Equations E4-10, E4-11, and E4-12. The variable  $ h_{o} $  is the distance between flange centroids as indicated in Figure C-E4.2. The torsional effective length,  $ L_{cz} $ , is the length between points where torsional rotation is restrained. The empirical factor  $ \omega $  was included to address some of the assumptions made in the original derivation. The expressions from Timoshenko and Gere (1961) were developed assuming that continuous lateral restraint was provided that is infinitely stiff. The impact of the continuous bracing assumption is not that significant because the column will generally be checked for buckling between discrete brace points. However, the assumption of the infinitely stiff lateral bracing will result in a reduction in the capacity for systems with finite brace stiffness. The  $ \omega $ -factor that is shown in Equations C-E4-1 and C-E4-2 is included to account for the reduction due to a finite brace stiffness. With a modest brace stiffness (such as stiffness values recommended in the Appendix 6 lateral bracing provisions), the reduction is relatively small and a value of 0.9 is recommended based upon finite element studies (Errera, 1976; Helwig and Yura, 1999). The  $ \omega $ -factor is taken as 1.0 here with little loss of accuracy.

It is important to recognize that as a lateral brace is moved away from the shear center, it permits the flexural buckling stiffness to interact with the torsional buckling stiffness to yield a constrained-axis torsional buckling strength less than the pure torsional buckling strength had the brace not existed. Figure C-E4.3 shows that, for a column with lateral and torsional restraint at the ends only and lateral bracing at mid-height, the torsional strength is greatest when the lateral brace is located at the shear center and diminishes, approaching the weak-axis flexural buckling strength for a column with effective length equal to  $ L_{cz} $ , as the lateral brace moves away from the shear center.

The specific method of calculating the buckling strength of double-angle and tee-shaped members that had been given in the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010) was deleted in the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016) in preference for the use of the general flexural-torsional buckling equations because the deleted equation was usually more conservative than necessary.

Equations E4-2, E4-7, E4-10, and E4-12 contain a torsional buckling effective length,  $ L_{cz} $ . This effective length may be conservatively taken as the length of the column. For greater accuracy, if both ends of the column have a connection that restrains warping, say by boxing the end over a length at least equal to the depth of the member, the effective length may be taken as 0.5 times the column length. If one end of the member is restrained from warping and the other end is free to warp, then the effective length may be taken as 0.7 times the column length.

At points of bracing both lateral and/or torsional bracing shall be provided, as required in Appendix 6. AISC Design Guide 9, Torsional Analysis of Structural Steel Members (Seaburg and Carter, 1997), provides an overview of the fundamentals of torsional loading for structural steel members. Design examples are also included.

### E5. SINGLE-ANGLE COMPRESSION MEMBERS

The compressive strength of single angles is to be determined in accordance with Sections E3 or E7 for the limit state of flexural buckling and Section E4 for the limit state of flexural-torsional buckling. However, single angles with  $ b/t \leq 0.71\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  do not require consideration of flexural-torsional buckling according to Section E4. This applies to all currently produced hot-rolled angles with  $ F_{y} = 36 $  ksi (250 MPa) but does not apply to all angles when  $ F_{y} > 36 $  ksi (250 MPa). Use Section E4 to compute  $ F_{e} $  for single angles only when  $ b/t > 0.71\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ .

Section E5 also provides a simplified procedure for the design of single angles subjected to an axial compressive load introduced through one connected leg as discussed by Lutz (2006). The angle is treated as an axially loaded member by adjusting the member slenderness. The attached leg is to be attached to a gusset plate or the

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_15_img_in_chart_box_109_749_755_1154.jpg" ></div>

projecting leg of another member by welding or by a bolted connection with at least two bolts. The equivalent slenderness expressions in this section presume significant restraint about the axis, which is perpendicular to the connected leg. This leads to the angle member tending to bend and buckle primarily about the axis parallel to the attached gusset. For this reason,  $ L/r_{a} $  is the slenderness parameter used, where the subscript, a, represents the axis parallel to the attached leg. This may be the x- or y-axis of the angle, depending on which leg is the attached leg. The modified slenderness ratios indirectly account for bending in the angles due to the eccentricity of loading and for the effects of end restraint from the members to which they are attached.

The equivalent slenderness expressions also presume a degree of rotational restraint. Equations E5-3 and E5-4 [Section E5(b), referred to as case (b)] assume a higher degree of rotational restraint about the axis parallel to the attached leg than do Equations E5-1 and E5-2 [Section E5(a), referred to as case (a)]. Equations E5-3 and E5-4 are essentially equivalent to those employed for equal-leg angles as web members in latticed transmission towers in ASCE 10-97 (ASCE, 2000).

In space trusses, the web members framing in from one face typically restrain the twist of the chord at the panel points and thus provide significant restraint about the axis parallel to the attached leg for the angles under consideration. It is possible that the chords of a planar truss well restrained against twist justify use of case (b), in other words, Equations E5-3 and E5-4. Similarly, simple single-angle diagonal braces in braced frames could be considered to have enough end restraint such that case (a), in other words, Equations E5-1 and E5-2, could be employed for their design. The provisions in this section, however, are not intended for the evaluation of the compressive strength of X-brace single angles.

The procedure in Section E5 permits use of unequal-leg angles attached by the smaller leg provided that the equivalent slenderness is increased by an amount that is a function of the ratio of the longer to the shorter leg lengths.

If the single-angle compression members cannot be evaluated using the procedures in this section, use the provisions of Section H2. In evaluating  $ P_{n} $ , the effective length due to end restraint should be considered. With values of effective length about the geometric axes, one can use the procedure in Lutz (1992) to compute an effective radius of gyration for the column. To obtain results that are not too conservative, one must also consider that end restraint reduces the eccentricity of the axial load of single-angle struts and thus the value of  $ f_{rbw} $  or  $ f_{rbz} $  used in the flexural term(s) in Equation H2-1.

### E6. BUILT-UP MEMBERS

Section E6 addresses the strength and dimensional requirements of built-up members composed of two or more shapes interconnected by stitch bolts or welds.

Two types of built-up members are commonly used for steel construction: closely spaced steel shapes interconnected at intervals using welds or bolts, and laced or battened members with widely spaced flange components. The compressive strength of built-up members is affected by the interaction between the global buckling mode of the member and the localized component buckling mode between lacing points.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_11.md -->

or intermediate connectors. Duan et al. (2002) refer to this type of buckling as compound buckling.

For both types of built-up members, limiting the slenderness ratio of each component shape between connection fasteners or welds, or between lacing points, as applicable, to 75% of the governing global slenderness ratio of the built-up member effectively mitigates the effect of compound buckling (Duan et al., 2002). For cases where the effect of compound buckling is mitigated by other measures, this requirement may be overly conservative.

### 1. Compressive Strength

This section applies to built-up members such as double-angle or double-channel members with closely spaced individual components. The longitudinal spacing of connectors connecting components of built-up compression members must be such that the slenderness ratio,  $ L_{c}/r $ , of individual shapes does not exceed three-fourths of the slenderness ratio of the entire member. However, this requirement does not necessarily mean that the effective slenderness ratio of the built-up member is equal to that of a built-up member acting as a single unit.

For a built-up member to be effective as a structural member, the end connection must be welded or pretensioned bolted with Class A or B faying surfaces. Even so, the compressive strength will be affected by the shearing deformation of the intermediate connectors. This Specification uses the effective slenderness ratio to consider this effect. Based mainly on the test data of Zandonini (1985), Zahn and Haaijer (1987) developed an empirical formulation of the effective slenderness ratio for the 1986 LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986). When pretensioned bolted or welded intermediate connectors are used, Aslani and Goel (1991) developed a semi-analytical formula for use in the 1993, 1999, and 2005 AISC Specifications (AISC, 1993, 2000b, 2005b). As more test data became available, a statistical evaluation (Sato and Uang, 2007) showed that the simplified expressions used in this Specification achieve the same level of accuracy.

To determine the forces in connectors of built-up members, the designer must first consider the buckling modes of the compression member. For example, for the built-up double-angle member in Figure C-E6.1, flexural buckling about the x-axis will not produce forces in the connectors, because the buckling mode does not lead to a relative shear between the two angles. However, buckling about the y-axis will produce a force in the connectors, because the fasteners must control the shear deformation between the two angles. The fasteners in the end connection must be pretensioned to provide slip resistance in order to rely on the built-up section properties.

Considering buckling of the built-up double-angle in Figure C-E6.1 about the y-axis, the connections between individual components carry no force when the member is perfectly straight in the unbuckled configuration under load. In order to rely on the section properties of the built-up member, slip must be prevented at the ends of the member by either pretensioned bolts or welds. The shear force in the end connections depends on the assumed buckled shape and the initial out-of-straightness. The buckled shape can be approximated as a half-sine wave and the initial member out-of-straightness as 0.001L. Using a second-order amplification of the initial out-of-straightness,  $ B_{1} $ , as given in Appendix 8, the required end connector shear force can be taken as

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_12.md -->

 $$ V_{r}=0.001LB_{1}\alpha P_{r}\frac{Q_{y}}{I_{y}} $$ 

where

 $ B_{1} $  = multiplier to account for  $ P-\delta $  effects (Appendix 8)

 $ I_{y} $  = moment of inertia of the built-up section about the y-axis, the axis that puts shear in the connectors, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

 $$ L = length of member, in. (mm) \\ P_r = required axial compressive strength, kips (N) $$ 



 $ Q_{y}= $  first moment of the area of one component about the y-axis, in. $ ^{3} $  (mm $ ^{3} $ )  $ \alpha=1.0 $  (LRFD); 1.6 (ASD)



For compression members in the elastic range, the maximum second-order amplification is  $ B_{1}=4.75 $ . In the inelastic range, the second-order amplification may be significantly smaller and the resulting required connector shear force will be smaller than that given by Equation C-E6-1 with  $ B_{1}=4.75 $  (Geschwindner, 2020).

Although intermediate connectors can develop shear, the force in the fasteners is generally much lower than forces at the end connections. For example, fasteners at the third points of the column length can be shown to carry approximately 13% of the total shear calculated by Equation C-E6-1. There is no requirement that intermediate connectors be pretensioned. However, the modified slenderness ratio will vary depending on whether the intermediate bolts are snug-tight or pretensioned. Because the total shear force is to be carried by the end connections, intermediate connectors at locations other than the third points could conservatively be designed for 13% of the total shear calculated by Equation C-E6-1.

Fastener spacing less than the maximum required for strength may be needed to establish a close fit over the entire faying surface of components in continuous contact. Special requirements for weathering steel members exposed to atmospheric corrosion are given in Brockenbrough (1983).

### 2. General Requirements

where the individual components are widely spaced are also provided. Some dimensioning requirements are based upon judgment and experience. The provisions governing the proportioning of perforated cover plates are based upon extensive experimental research (Stang and Jaffe, 1948).

### E7. MEMBERS WITH SLENDER ELEMENTS

The structural engineer designing with hot-rolled shapes will seldom find an occasion to turn to Section E7. Among rolled shapes, the most frequently encountered cases requiring the application of this section are beam shapes used as columns, columns containing angles with thin legs, and tee-shaped columns having slender stems. Special attention to the determination of effective area must be given when columns are made by welding or bolting thin plates together or ultra-high strength steels are employed.

The provisions of Section E7 address the modifications to be made when one or more plate elements in the column cross section are slender. A plate element is considered to be slender if its width-to-thickness ratio exceeds the limiting value,  $ \lambda_{r} $ , defined in Table B4.1a. If the plate element is not slender, it can support the full yield stress without local buckling. When the cross section contains slender elements, the potential reduction in capacity due to local-global buckling interaction must be accounted for.

Since the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016), local-global interaction is accounted for via the effective width approach. This method has been used for both stiffened and unstiffened cross-section elements in the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members since 2001 (AISI, 2001) and was validated by Seif and Schafer (2014) for structural steel shapes. Prior to 2016, the Specification used the Q-factor approach for local-global interaction (Ziemian, 2010) and only stiffened elements included the potential for local post-buckling capacity, while unstiffened elements were assumed to be limited by their elastic local buckling stress.

### 1. Slender Element Members Excluding Round HSS

The effective width method is employed for determining the reduction in capacity due to local buckling. The effective width method was developed by von Kármán et al. (1932), empirically modified by Winter (1947), and generalized for local-global buckling interaction by Peköz (1987); see Ziemian (2010) for a complete summary. The point at which the slender element begins to influence column strength,  $ \lambda_{r}\sqrt{F_{y}/F_{n}} $ , is a function of element slenderness from Table B4.1a and column slenderness as reflected through  $ F_{n} $ . This reflects the unified effective width approach where the maximum stress in the effective width formulation is the column stress,  $ F_{n} $  (as opposed to  $ F_{y} $ ). This implies that columns designated as having slender elements by Table B4.1a may not necessarily see any reduction in strength due to local buckling, depending on the column stress,  $ F_{n} $ .

Prior to the 2016 AISC Specification, the effective width,  $ b_{e} $ , of a stiffened element was expressed as

 $$ b_{e}=1.92t\sqrt{\frac{E}{f}}\left(1-\frac{0.34}{(b/t)}\sqrt{\frac{E}{f}}\right)\leq b $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_14.md -->

where

 $ E = \text{modulus of elasticity, ksi (MPa)} $ 

b = width of stiffened compression element, in. (mm)

f = critical stress when slender element is not considered, ksi (MPa)

t = thickness of element, in. (mm)

This may be compared with the generalized effective width, Equation E7-3:

 $$ b_{e}=b\Biggl(1-c_{1}\sqrt{\frac{F_{el}}{F_{n}}}\Biggr)\sqrt{\frac{F_{el}}{F_{n}}} $$ 

where  $ F_{el} $  is the local elastic buckling stress, and  $ c_{1} $  is the empirical correction factor typically associated with imperfection sensitivity. The two expressions are essentially equivalent if one recognizes that

 $$ F_{el}=k\frac{\pi^{2}E}{12(1-\mathrm{v}^{2})}\bigg(\frac{t}{b}\bigg)^{2} $$ 

where

 $$ \begin{aligned}v&=Poisson^{\prime}s ratio\\&=0.3\end{aligned} $$ 

and utilizes k = 4.0 for the stiffened element,  $ c_{1} = 0.18 $  for the imperfection sensitivity factor, and sets  $ f = F_{n} $ .

Equation E7-3 provides an effective width expression applicable to both stiffened and unstiffened elements. Further, by making elastic local buckling explicit in the expression, the potential to use analysis to determine  $ F_{el} $  is also allowed [see Seif and Schafer (2010)]. For ultra-high-strength steel sections or sections built-up from thin plates, this can be especially useful.

Equation E7-5 provides an explicit expression for elastic local buckling,  $ F_{el} $ . This expression is based on the assumptions implicit in Table B4.1a and was determined as follows. At the limiting width-to-thickness ratio,  $ \lambda = \lambda_{r} $ ,  $ b = b_{e} $ , and  $ F_{el} = F_{el-r} $ ; therefore, at this limit, local elastic buckling implies

 $$ F_{el-r}=k\frac{\pi^{2}E}{12(1-\mathrm{v}^{2})}\Bigg(\frac{t}{b}\Bigg)^{2}=k\frac{\pi^{2}E}{12(1-\mathrm{v}^{2})}\Bigg(\frac{1}{\lambda_{r}}\Bigg)^{2} $$ 

and the effective width expression simplifies to

 $$ 1=\left(1-c_{1}\sqrt{\frac{F_{el-r}}{F_{y}}}\right)\sqrt{\frac{F_{el-r}}{F_{y}}} $$ 

which may be used to back-calculate the plate buckling coefficient, k, assumed in Table B4.1a:

 $$ k=\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4c_{1}}}{2c_{1}}\right)^{2}\frac{12\left(1-\mathrm{v}^{2}\right)}{\pi^{2}}\frac{F_{y}}{E}\lambda_{r}^{2} $$ 

This relationship provides a prediction of the elastic local buckling stress consistent with the k implicit in Table B4.1a, after substitution:

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_15.md -->

 $$ F_{el}=\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4c_{1}}}{2c_{1}}\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\right)^{2}F_{y}=\left(c_{2}\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\right)^{2}F_{y} $$ 

Thus,  $ \lambda_{r} $  from Table B4.1a may be used to determine k, which may be used to determine the elastic local buckling stress. Further,  $ c_{2} $  is shown to be determined by  $ c_{1} $  alone, and is used only for convenience.

Equation E7-3 has long been used in the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI, 2016) with  $ c_{1}=0.22 $  for both stiffened and unstiffened elements. The same  $ c_{1} $  factor is adopted here for all elements, except those that prior to the 2016 AISC Specification had explicit (and calibrated) effective width expressions.

One disadvantage of Equation E7-3, and the explicit use of  $ F_{el} $ , is the loss of convenience when working with a particular slender element. If Equation E7-5 is utilized directly, then Equation E7-3 may be simplified to

 $$ b_{e}=\left(1-c_{1}c_{2}\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}\right)c_{2}\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}b $$ 

or, more specifically, for case (a), stiffened elements, except walls of square and rectangular sections of uniform thickness,

 $$ b_{e}=\left(1-0.24\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}\right)1.31\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}b $$ 

for case (b), walls of square and rectangular sections of uniform thickness,

 $$ b_{e}=\left(1-0.28\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}\right)1.38\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}b $$ 

or, case (c), all other elements,

 $$ b_{e}=\left(1-0.33\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}\right)1.49\frac{\lambda_{r}}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{F_{n}}}b $$ 

These equations may be further simplified if the constants associated with the slenderness limit,  $ \lambda_{r} $ , are combined with the constants in Table E7.1. This results in

 $$ b_{e}=c_{2}c_{3}t\sqrt{\frac{k_{c}E}{F_{n}}}\left(1-\frac{c_{1}c_{2}c_{3}}{\left(b/t\right)}\sqrt{\frac{k_{c}E}{F_{n}}}\right) $$ 

where  $ c_{3} $  is the constant associated with slenderness limits given in Table B4.1a (Geschwindner and Troemner, 2016). Combining the constants in Equation C-E7-12 with  $ c_{4}=c_{2}c_{3} $  and  $ c_{5}=c_{1}c_{2}c_{3} $  yields

 $$ b_{e}=c_{4}t\sqrt{\frac{k_{c}E}{F_{n}}}\left(1-\frac{c_{5}}{\left(b/t\right)}\sqrt{\frac{k_{c}E}{F_{n}}}\right) $$

The constants  $ c_{4} $  and  $ c_{5} $  are given in Table C-E7.1 for each of the cases in Table B4.1a, excluding round HSS.

The impact of the changes to the effective width approach implemented in the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016) for treatment of slender-element compression members is greatest for unstiffened-element compression members and may be negligible for stiffened-element compression members as shown by Geschwindner and Troemner (2016).

### 2. Round HSS

The classical theory of longitudinally compressed cylinders overestimates the actual buckling strength, often by 200% or more. Inevitable imperfections of shape and the eccentricity of the load are responsible for the reduction in actual strength below the theoretical strength. The limits in this section are based upon test evidence (Sherman, 1976), rather than theoretical calculations, that local buckling will not occur if  $ D/t \leq 0.11E/F_{y} $ . When D/t exceeds this value but is less than  $ 0.45E/F_{y} $ , Equation E7-7 provides a reduction in the local buckling effective area. This Specification does not recommend the use of round HSS or pipe columns with  $ D/t > 0.45E/F_{y} $ .

Following the SSRC recommendations (Ziemian, 2010) and the approach used for other shapes with slender compression elements, an effective area is used in Section E7 for round sections to account for interaction between local and column buckling. The effective area is determined based on the ratio between the local buckling stress and the yield stress. The local buckling stress for the round section is taken from AISI provisions based on inelastic action (Winter, 1970) and is based on tests conducted on fabricated and manufactured cylinders. Subsequent tests on fabricated cylinders (Ziemian, 2010) confirm that this equation is conservative.

# CHAPTER F DESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR FLEXURE

Chapter F includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Strength equations for HSS and box sections have been reformatted and a restriction provided for box sections with slender webs and slender flanges.

(2) Provisions for rectangular bars and rounds have been simplified although no changes in resulting strength have been made.

(3) For flexural strength of members with holes in the tension flange it has been clarified that these provisions apply only to bolt holes.

(4) Requirements for unbraced length with moment redistribution have been moved to Appendix 8.

Chapter F applies to members subjected to simple bending about one principal axis of the cross section. That is, the member is loaded in a plane parallel to a principal axis that passes through the shear center. Simple bending may also be attained if all load points and supports are restrained against twisting about the longitudinal axis. In all cases, the provisions of this chapter are based on the assumption that points of support for all members are restrained against rotation about their longitudinal axis. Because the strength equations presented in this chapter are based on theory and testing, they are based in part on the tolerances provided in the applicable material standards. If those tolerances are exceeded, appropriate reductions in strength may be needed.

Section F2 gives the provisions for the flexural strength of doubly symmetric compact I-shaped and channel members subjected to bending about their major axis. For most designers, the provisions in this section will be sufficient to perform their everyday designs. The remaining sections of Chapter F address less frequently occurring cases encountered by structural engineers. Because there are many such cases, many equations and many pages in the Specification, the table in User Note F1.1 is provided as a map for navigating through the cases considered in Chapter F. The coverage of the chapter is extensive and there are many equations that appear formidable; however, it is stressed again that for most designs, the engineer need seldom go beyond Section F2. AISC Design Guide 25, Frame Design Using Nonprismatic Members (White et al., 2021), addresses flexural strength for web-tapered members.

For all cross sections covered in Chapter F, the highest possible nominal flexural strength is the plastic moment,  $ M_{n} = M_{p} $ . Being able to use this value in design represents the optimum use of the steel. In order to attain  $ M_{p} $ , the beam cross section must be compact and the member must have sufficient lateral bracing.

Compactness depends on the flange and web width-to-thickness ratios, as defined in Section B4. When these conditions are not met, the nominal flexural strength diminishes. All sections in Chapter F treat this reduction in the same way. For beams with full lateral bracing, the plastic moment region extends over the range of width-to-thickness ratios,  $ \lambda $ , terminating

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_18.md -->

at  $ \lambda_{p} $ . This is the compact condition. Beyond these limits, the nominal flexural strength reduces linearly until  $ \lambda $  reaches  $ \lambda_{r} $ . This is the range where the cross section is noncompact. Beyond  $ \lambda_{r} $  the cross section is a slender-element section. These three ranges are illustrated in Figure C-F1.1 for the case of rolled wide-flange members for the limit state of flange local buckling. The curve in Figure C-F1.1 shows the relationship between the flange width-to-thickness ratio,  $ b_{f}/2t_{f} $ , and the nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ .

The basic relationship between the nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , and the unbraced length,  $ L_{b} $ , for the limit state of lateral-torsional buckling is shown by the solid curve in Figure C-F1.2 for a compact section that is simply supported and subjected to uniform bending with  $ C_{b} = 1.0 $ .

For the case of rolled wide-flange members, there are three principal zones defined on the basic curve by the lengths  $ L_{p} $  and  $ L_{r} $ . Equation F2-5 defines the maximum unbraced length,  $ L_{p} $ , to reach  $ M_{p} $  with uniform moment. Elastic lateral-torsional buckling will occur when the unbraced length is greater than  $ L_{r} $ , given by Equation F2-6. Equation F2-2 defines the range of inelastic lateral-torsional buckling as a straight line between the defined limits  $ M_{p} $  at  $ L_{p} $  and  $ 0.7F_{y}S_{x} $  at  $ L_{r} $ . Buckling strength in the elastic region is given by Equation F2-3 in combination with Equation F2-4.

For other than uniform moment along the member length, the lateral buckling strength is obtained by multiplying the basic strength in the elastic and inelastic region by  $ C_{b} $  as shown in Figure C-F1.2. However, in no case can the maximum nominal flexural strength exceed the plastic moment,  $ M_{p} $ . Note that  $ L_{p} $  given by Equation F2-5 has physical meaning only for  $ C_{b}=1.0 $ . For  $ C_{b} $  greater than 1.0, members with larger unbraced lengths can reach  $ M_{p} $ , as shown by the dashed curve for  $ C_{b}>1.0 $  in Figure C-F1.2. The largest length at which  $ M_{n}=M_{p} $  is calculated by setting Equation F2-2 equal to  $ M_{p} $  and solving for  $ L_{b} $  using the actual value of  $ C_{b} $ .

### F1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Throughout Chapter F, the resistance factor and the safety factor remain unchanged, regardless of the controlling limit state. This includes the limit state defined in Section F13 for design of flexural members with bolt holes in the tension flange where rupture is the controlling limit state (Geschwindner, 2010a).

In addition, the requirement that all supports for flexural members be restrained against rotation about the longitudinal axis is stipulated. Although there are provisions for members unbraced along their length, under no circumstances can the supports remain unrestrained torsionally.

Beginning with the 1961 AISC Specification (AISC, 1961) and continuing through the 1986 LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986), the following equation was used to adjust the lateral-torsional buckling equations for variations in the moment diagram within the unbraced length:

 $$ C_{b}=1.75+1.05\Bigg(\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}\Bigg)+0.3\Bigg(\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}\Bigg)^{2}\leq2.3 $$ 

where

 $ M_{1}= $  smaller moment at end of unbraced length, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{2}= $  larger moment at end of unbraced length, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ \left(M_{1}/M_{2}\right) $  is positive when moments cause reverse curvature and negative for single curvature

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_15_img_in_chart_box_188_705_667_1091.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_20.md -->

This equation is applicable strictly only to moment diagrams that consist of straight lines between braced points—a condition that is rare in beam design. The equation provides a lower bound to the solutions developed in Salvadori (1956). Equation C-F1-1 can be applied to nonlinear moment diagrams by using a straight line between  $ M_{2} $  and the moment at the middle of the unbraced length and taking  $ M_{1} $  as the value on this straight line at the opposite end of the unbraced length (AASHTO, 2014). If the moment at the middle of the unbraced length is greater than  $ M_{2} $ ,  $ C_{b} $  is conservatively taken equal to 1.0 when applying Equation C-F1-1 in this manner.

Kirby and Nethercot (1979) present an equation that is a direct fit to various nonlinear moment diagrams within the unbraced segment. Their original equation was slightly adjusted to give Equation C-F1-2a (Equation F1-1 in this Specification):

 $$ C_{b}=\frac{12.5M_{max}}{2.5M_{max}+3M_{A}+4M_{B}+3M_{C}} $$ 

This equation gives a more accurate solution for unbraced lengths in which the moment diagram deviates substantially from a straight line, such as the case of a fixed-end beam with no lateral bracing within the span, subjected to a uniformly distributed transverse load. It gives slightly conservative results compared to Equation C-F1-1, in most cases, for moment diagrams with straight lines between points of bracing. The absolute values of the three quarter-point moments and the maximum moment, regardless of its location, are used in Equation C-F1-2a. Wong and Driver (2010) review a number of approaches and recommend the following alternative quarter-point equation for use with doubly symmetric I-shaped members:

 $$ C_{b}=\frac{4M_{max}}{\sqrt{M_{max}^{2}+4M_{A}^{2}+7M_{B}^{2}+4M_{C}^{2}}} $$ 

This equation gives improved predictions for a number of important cases, including cases with moderately nonlinear moment diagrams. The maximum moment in the unbraced segment is used in all cases for comparison with the nominal moment,  $ M_{n} $ . In addition, the length between braces, not the distance to inflection points, is used in all cases.

The lateral-torsional buckling modification factor given by Equation C-F1-2a is applicable for doubly symmetric sections and singly symmetric sections in single curvature. It should be modified for application with singly symmetric sections in reverse curvature. Previous work considered the behavior of singly symmetric I-shaped beams subjected to gravity loading (Helwig et al., 1997). The study resulted in the following expression:

 $$ C_{b}=\left(\frac{12.5M_{max}}{2.5M_{max}+3M_{A}+4M_{B}+3M_{C}}\right)R_{m}\leq3.0 $$ 

For single curvature bending

 $$ R_{m}=1.0 $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_21.md -->

For reverse curvature bending

 $$ R_{m}=0.5+2\Bigg(\frac{I_{y Top}}{I_{y}}\Bigg)^{2} $$ 

where

 $ I_{y\ Top}= $  moment of inertia of the top flange about an axis in the plane of the web, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

 $ I_{y} $  = moment of inertia of the entire section about an axis in the plane of the web, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

Equation C-F1-3 was developed for gravity loading on beams with a horizontal orientation of the longitudinal axis. For more general cases, the top flange is defined as the flange on the opposite side of the web mid-depth from the direction of the transverse loading. The term in parentheses in Equation C-F1-3 is identical to Equation C-F1-2a, while the factor  $ R_{m} $  is a modifier for singly symmetric sections that is greater than unity when the top flange is the larger flange and less than unity when the top flange is the smaller flange. For singly symmetric sections subjected to reverse curvature bending, the lateral-torsional buckling strength should be evaluated by separately treating each flange as the compression flange and comparing the available flexural strength with the required moment that causes compression in the flange under consideration.

The  $ C_{b} $  factors discussed in the foregoing are defined as a function of the spacing between braced points. However, many situations arise where a beam may be subjected to reverse curvature bending and have one of the flanges continuously braced laterally by closely spaced joists and/or light gage decking normally used for roofing or flooring systems. Although the lateral bracing provides significant restraint to one of the flanges, the other flange can still buckle laterally due to the compression caused by the reverse curvature bending. A variety of  $ C_{b} $  expressions have been developed that are a function of the type of loading, distribution of the moment, and the support conditions. For gravity loaded rolled I-section beams with the top flange laterally restrained, the following expression is applicable (Yura, 1995; Yura and Helwig, 2010):

 $$ C_{b}=3.0-\frac{2}{3}\Bigg(\frac{M_{1}}{M_{o}}\Bigg)-\frac{8}{3}\Bigg(\frac{M_{CL}}{\left(M_{o}+M_{1}\right)^{*}}\Bigg) $$ 

where

 $ M_{o} $  = moment at the end of the unbraced length that gives the largest compressive stress in the bottom flange, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ M_{1} $  = moment at other end of the unbraced length, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $$ M_{CL}=moment at the middle of the unbraced length,kip-in.(N-mm) $$ 

 $$ \left(M_{o}+M_{1}\right)^{*} = M_{o}, \text{ if } M_{1} \text{ is positive, causing tension on the bottom flange} $$ 

The unbraced length is defined as the spacing between locations where twist is restrained. The sign convention for the moments is shown in Figure C-F1.3.  $ M_{o} $ ,  $ M_{1} $ , and  $ M_{CL} $  are all taken as positive when they cause compression on the top flange, and they are taken as negative when they cause compression on the bottom flange, as shown in the figure. The asterisk on the last term in Equation C-F1-5 indicates

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_22.md -->

that  $ M_{1} $  is taken as zero in the last term if it is positive. For example, considering the distribution of moment shown in Figure C-F1.4, the  $ C_{b} $  value would be

 $$ C_{b}=3.0-\frac{2}{3}\Bigg(\frac{+200}{-100}\Bigg)-\frac{8}{3}\Bigg(\frac{+50}{-100}\Bigg)=5.67 $$ 

Note that  $ \left(M_{o}+M_{1}\right)^{*} $  is taken as  $ M_{o} $  because  $ M_{1} $  is positive.

In this case,  $ C_{b} = 5.67 $  would be used with the lateral-torsional buckling strength for the beam using an unbraced length of 20 ft (6.1 m), which is defined by the locations where twist or lateral movement of both flanges is restrained.

A similar buckling problem occurs with rolled I-shaped roofing beams subjected to uplift from wind loading. The light gage metal decking that is used for the roofing system usually provides continuous restraint to the top flange of the beam; however, the uplift can be large enough to cause the bottom flange to be in compression. The sign convention for the moment is the same as indicated in Figure C-F1.3. The moment must cause compression in the bottom flange ( $ M_{CL} $  negative) for the beam to buckle. Three different expressions are given in Figure C-F1.5 depending on whether the end moments are positive or negative (Yura and Helwig, 2010). As outlined in

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_15_img_in_image_box_165_555_697_822.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_23.md -->

the foregoing, the unbraced length is defined as the spacing between points where both the top and bottom flange are restrained from lateral movement or between points restrained from twist.

The equations for the limit state of lateral-torsional buckling in Chapter F assume that the loads are applied along the beam centroidal axis.  $ C_{b} $  may be conservatively taken equal to 1.0, with the exception of some cases involving unbraced overhangs or members with no bracing within the span and with significant loading applied to the top flange. If the load is placed on the top flange and the flange is not braced, there is a tipping effect that reduces the critical moment; conversely, if the load is suspended from an unbraced bottom flange, there is a stabilizing effect that increases the critical moment (Ziemian, 2010). For unbraced top flange loading on compact I-shaped members, the reduced critical moment may be conservatively approximated by setting the square root expression in Equation F2-4 equal to unity.

An effective length factor of unity is implied in the critical moment equations to represent the worst-case simply supported unbraced segment. Consideration of any end restraint due to adjacent unbuckled segments on the critical segment can increase its strength. The effects of beam continuity on lateral-torsional buckling have been studied, and a simple conservative design method based on the analogy to end-restrained nonsway columns with an effective length less than unity is proposed in Ziemian (2010).

### F2. DOUBLY SYMMETRIC COMPACT I-SHAPED MEMBERS AND CHANNELS BENT ABOUT THEIR MAJOR AXIS

Section F2 applies to members with compact I-shaped or channel cross sections subjected to bending about their major axis; hence, the only limit state to consider is lateral-torsional buckling. Almost all rolled wide-flange shapes listed in the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017) are eligible to be designed by the provisions of this section, as indicated in the User Note in this section.

The flexural strength equations in Section F2 are nearly identical to the corresponding equations in Section F1 of the 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b), and are the same as those that have been in the Specification since 2005 (AISC, 2005b). Table C-F2.1 gives the list of equivalent equations.

The only difference between the 1999 LRFD Specification and this Specification is that the stress at the interface between inelastic and elastic buckling has been changed from  $ F_{y}-F_{r} $  in the 1999 edition to  $ 0.7F_{y} $ . In the Specifications prior to the 2005 AISC Specification, the residual stress,  $ F_{r} $ , for rolled and welded shapes was different, namely 10 ksi (69 MPa) and 16.5 ksi (110 MPa), respectively, while since the 2005 AISC Specification the residual stress has been taken as  $ 0.3F_{y} $  so that the value of  $ F_{y}-F_{r}=0.7F_{y} $  is adopted. This change was made in the interest of simplicity; in addition, this modification provides a slightly improved correlation with experimental data (White, 2008).

The elastic lateral-torsional buckling stress,  $ F_{cr} $ , of Equation F2-4,

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{C_{b}\pi^{2}E}{\left(\frac{L_{b}}{r_{ts}}\right)^{2}}\sqrt{1+0.078\frac{Jc}{S_{x}h_{o}}\left(\frac{L_{b}}{r_{ts}}\right)^{2}} $$ 

is identical to Equation F1-13 in the 1999 LRFD Specification:

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{M_{cr}}{S_{x}}=\frac{C_{b}\pi}{L_{b}S_{x}}\sqrt{EI_{y}GJ+\left(\frac{\pi E}{L_{b}}\right)^{2}I_{y}C_{w}} $$ 

This equation may be rearranged to the form,

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{C_{b}\pi^{2}E}{L_{b}^{2}}\frac{\sqrt{I_{y}C_{w}}}{S_{x}}\sqrt{1+\frac{GJ}{EC_{w}}\left(\frac{L_{b}}{\pi}\right)^{2}} $$ 

By using the definitions.

 $$ r_{ts}{}^{2}=\frac{\sqrt{I_{y}C_{w}}}{S_{x}},C_{w}=\frac{I_{y}h_{o}^{2}}{4},\mathrm{a n d}c=1 $$ 

for doubly symmetric I-shaped members, Equation C-F2-1 is obtained after some algebraic rearrangement. Section F2 provides an alternative definition for c, based on the expression for  $ C_{w} $  of channels, which allows the use of Equation C-F2-1 for channel shapes.

Equation F2-5 is the same as F1-4 in the 1999 LRFD Specification and Equation F2-6 corresponds to F1-6. It is obtained by setting  $ F_{cr} = 0.7F_{y} $  in Equation F2-4 and solving for  $ L_{b} $ . The format of Equation F2-6 was changed for the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC 2010) so that it is not undefined at the limit when J = 0; otherwise, it gives identical results. The term  $ r_{ts} $  can be approximated accurately as the radius of gyration of the compression flange plus one-sixth of the web.

These provisions are much simpler than the previous ASD provisions and are based on a more informed understanding of beam limit states behavior (White and Chang, 2007). The maximum allowable stress obtained in these provisions may be slightly higher than the previous limit of  $ 0.66F_{y} $ , because the true plastic strength of the member is reflected by use of the plastic section modulus in Equation F2-1. The Section F2 provisions for unbraced length are satisfied through the use of two equations: one for inelastic lateral-torsional buckling (Equation F2-2), and one for elastic lateral-torsional buckling (Equation F2-3). Previous ASD provisions placed an arbitrary stress limit of  $ 0.6F_{y} $  when a beam was not fully braced and required that three equations be checked with the selection of the largest stress to determine the strength of a laterally unbraced beam. With the current provisions, once the unbraced length is determined, the member strength can be obtained directly from these equations.

### F3. DOUBLY SYMMETRIC I-SHAPED MEMBERS WITH COMPACT WEBS AND NONCOMPACT OR SLENDER FLANGES BENT ABOUT THEIR MAJOR AXIS

Section F3 is a supplement to Section F2 for the case where the flange of the section is either noncompact or slender (see Figure C-F1.1 where the linear variation of  $ M_{n} $  between  $ \lambda_{pf} $  and  $ \lambda_{rf} $  addresses noncompact behavior and the curve beyond  $ \lambda_{rf} $  addresses slender behavior). As pointed out in the User Note of Section F2, very few rolled wide-flange shapes are subject to this criterion. However, any built-up doubly symmetric I-shaped member with a compact web and a noncompact or slender flange would require use of the provisions in this section.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_26.md -->

### F4. OTHER I-SHAPED MEMBERS WITH COMPACT OR NONCOMPACT WEBS BENT ABOUT THEIR MAJOR AXIS

The provisions of Section F4 are applicable to doubly symmetric I-shaped beams with noncompact webs and to singly symmetric I-shaped members with compact or noncompact webs (see the table in User Note F1.1). This section addresses welded I-shaped beams where the webs are not slender. The flanges may be compact, non-compact, or slender. The contents of Section F4 are based on White (2008).

Four limit states are considered in Section F4: (a) compression flange yielding; (b) lateral-torsional buckling; (c) compression flange local buckling; and (d) tension flange yielding. The effect of inelastic local buckling of the web is addressed indirectly by multiplying the moment causing yielding in the compression flange by a factor,  $ R_{pc} $ , and the moment causing yielding in the tension flange by a factor,  $ R_{pt} $ . These two factors can vary from unity to as high as  $ M_{p}/M_{yc} \leq 1.6 $  and  $ M_{p}/M_{yt} \leq 1.6 $ . The maximum limit of 1.6 is intended to guard against substantial early yielding potentially leading to inelastic response under service conditions. They can be assumed to conservatively equal 1.0 although in many circumstances this will be much too conservative to be a reasonable assumption. The following steps are provided as a guide to the determination of  $ R_{pc} $  and  $ R_{pt} $ .

Step 1. Calculate  $ h_{p} $  and  $ h_{c} $ , as defined in Figure C-F4.1.

Step 2. Determine the web slenderness and the yield moments in compression and tension:



 $$ \begin{aligned}&\left\{\begin{aligned}\\ &\lambda=\frac{h_{c}}{t_{w}}\\&S_{xc}=\frac{I_{x}}{y};\ S_{xt}=\frac{I_{x}}{d-y}\\&M_{yc}=F_{y}S_{xc};\ M_{yt}=F_{y}S_{xt}\\ &\end{aligned}\right\}\\ \end{aligned} $$ 

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_15_img_in_chart_box_120_824_742_1185.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-F4.1. Elastic and plastic stress distributions.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_27.md -->

Step 3. Determine λpw and λrw:

 $$ \left\{\begin{aligned}\lambda_{pw}=&\frac{\frac{h_{c}}{h_{p}}\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}}}{\left(\frac{0.54M_{p}}{M_{y}}-0.09\right)^{2}}\leq5.70\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}}\\ \lambda_{rw}=&5.70\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}}\end{aligned}\right\} $$ 

If  $ \lambda > \lambda_{rw} $ , then the web is slender and the design is governed by Section F5. In extreme cases where the plastic neutral axis is located in the compression flange,  $ h_{p} = 0 $  and the web is considered to be compact.

Step 4. Calculate  $ R_{pc} $  and  $ R_{pt} $  using Section F4.

The basic maximum nominal moment is  $ R_{pc}M_{yc} = R_{pc}F_{y}S_{xc} $  corresponding to the compression flange, and  $ R_{pI}M_{yt} = R_{pI}F_{y}S_{xt} $  corresponding to tension flange yielding, which is applicable only when  $ M_{yt} < M_{yc} $  or  $ S_{xt} < S_{xc} $  (beams with the larger flange in compression). The Section F4 provisions parallel the rules for doubly symmetric members in Sections F2 and F3. Equations F2-4 and F2-6 are nearly the same as Equations F4-5 and F4-8, with the former using  $ S_{x} $  and the latter using  $ S_{xc} $ , both representing the elastic section modulus to the compression side. This is a simplification that tends to be somewhat conservative if the compression flange is smaller than the tension flange, and it is somewhat unconservative when the reverse is true (White and Jung, 2003). It is required to check for tension flange yielding if the tension flange is smaller than the compression flange (Section F4.4).

For a more accurate solution, especially when the loads are not applied at the centroid of the member, the designer is directed to Galambos (2001), White and Jung (2003), and Ziemian (2010). The following alternative equations in lieu of Equations F4-5 and F4-8 are provided by White and Jung:

 $$ M_{n}=C_{b}\frac{\pi^{2}EI_{y}}{L_{b}^{2}}\Bigg[\frac{\beta_{x}}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\beta_{x}}{2}\right)^{2}+\frac{C_{w}}{I_{y}}\bigg(1+0.0390\frac{J}{C_{w}}L_{b}^{2}\bigg)}\Bigg] $$ 

 $$ L_{r}=\frac{1.38E\sqrt{I_{y}J}}{S_{xc}F_{L}}\sqrt{\frac{2.6\beta_{x}F_{L}S_{xc}}{EJ}+1+\sqrt{\left(\frac{2.6\beta_{x}F_{L}S_{xc}}{EJ}+1\right)^{2}+\frac{27.0C_{w}}{I_{y}}\left(\frac{F_{L}S_{xc}}{EJ}\right)^{2}}} $$ 

where the coefficient of monosymmetry,  $ \beta_{x}=0.9h\alpha\left[\left(I_{yc}/I_{yt}\right)-1\right] $ , the warping constant,  $ C_{w}=h^{2}I_{yc}\alpha $ , where  $ \alpha=1/\left[\left(I_{yc}/I_{yt}\right)+1\right] $ , and  $ F_{L} $  is the magnitude of the flexural stress in compression at which the lateral-torsional buckling is influenced by yielding. In Equations F4-6a and F4-6b, this stress level is taken generally as the smaller of  $ 0.7F_{y} $  in the compression flange, or the compression flange stress when the tension flange reaches the yield strength, but not less than  $ 0.5F_{y} $ .

### F5. DOUBLY SYMMETRIC AND SINGLY SYMMETRIC I-SHAPED MEMBERS WITH SLENDER WEBS BENT ABOUT THEIR MAJOR AXIS

This section applies to doubly and singly symmetric I-shaped members with a slender web, that is,  $ h_{c}/t_{w} > \lambda_{r} = 5.70\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ . As is the case in Section F4, four limit states are considered: (a) compression flange yielding; (b) lateral-torsional buckling; (c) compression flange local buckling; and (d) tension flange yielding. The provisions in this section have changed little since 1963. The provisions are based on research reported in Basler and Thürlimann (1963).

There is no seamless transition between the equations in Section F4 and Section F5. The bending strength of a beam with  $ F_{y} = 50 $  ksi (345 MPa) and a web slenderness,  $ h/t_{w} = 137 $ , is not close to that of a beam with  $ h/t_{w} = 138 $ . These two slenderness ratios are on either side of the limiting ratio. This gap is caused by the discontinuity between the lateral-torsional buckling resistances predicted by Section F4 and those predicted by Section F5 due to the implicit use of J = 0 in Section F5. However, for typical I-shaped members with webs close to the noncompact web limit, the influence of J on the lateral-torsional buckling resistance is relatively small (for example, the calculated  $ L_{r} $  values including J versus using J = 0 typically differ by less than 10%). The implicit use of J = 0 in Section F5 is intended to account for the influence of web distortional flexibility on the lateral-torsional buckling resistance for slender-web I-section members.

### F6. I-SHAPED MEMBERS AND CHANNELS BENT ABOUT THEIR MINOR AXIS

I-shaped members and channels bent about their minor axis do not experience lateral-torsional buckling or web local buckling. The only limit states to consider are yielding and flange local buckling. The User Note informs the designer of the few rolled shapes that need to be checked for flange local buckling. The limiting width-to-thickness ratios for rolled I-shaped members given in Table B4.1b are the same for major- and minor-axis bending. This is a conservative simplification. The limit of  $ 1.6F_{y}S_{y} $  in Equation F6-1 is intended to guard against substantial early yielding in channels subjected to minor-axis bending, potentially leading to inelastic response under service conditions. The minor-axis plastic moment capacity of I-sections rarely exceeds this limit.

### F7. SQUARE AND RECTANGULAR HSS AND BOX SECTIONS

The provisions for the nominal flexural strength of HSS and box sections include the limit states of yielding, flange local buckling, web local buckling, and lateral-torsional buckling.

The provisions for local buckling of noncompact rectangular HSS are the same as those in the previous sections of this chapter:  $ M_{n}=M_{p} $  for  $ b/t\leq\lambda_{p} $ , and a linear transition from  $ M_{p} $  to  $ F_{y}S_{x} $  when  $ \lambda_{p}<b/t\leq\lambda_{r} $ . Equations F7-2 and F7-6 have been restructured to conform to similar equations for sections with noncompact elements in Chapter F and to include both HSS and box sections. The equation for the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_15/doc_29.md -->

effective width of the compression flange when b/t exceeds  $ \lambda_{r} $  is the same as that used for rectangular HSS in axial compression in the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), except that the stress is taken as the yield stress. This implies that the stress in the corners of the compression flange is at yield when the ultimate post-buckling strength of the flange is reached. When using the effective width, the nominal flexural strength is determined from the effective section modulus referred to the compression flange using the distance from the shifted neutral axis. A slightly conservative estimate of the nominal flexural strength can be obtained by using the effective width for both the compression and tension flange, thereby maintaining the symmetry of the cross section and simplifying the calculations. For box sections,  $ \lambda_{r} $  is the same as that used for uniformly compressed slender elements under compression in the 2010 AISC Specification.

Although there are no HSS with slender webs in flexural compression, Section F7.3(c) is included to account for box sections that may have slender webs. The provisions of Section F5 for I-shaped members have been adopted with a doubling of  $ a_{w} $  to account for two webs. Sections with slender webs and slender flanges are not considered in this Specification because their behavior is difficult to predict; such members should be used with care.

Because of the high torsional resistance of the closed cross section, the critical unbraced lengths,  $ L_{p} $  and  $ L_{r} $ , that correspond to the development of the plastic moment and the yield moment, respectively, are typically relatively large. For example, as shown in Figure C-F7.1, an HSS20×4×5/16 (HSS508×101.6×7.9), which has one of the largest depth-to-width ratios among standard HSS, has  $ L_{p} $  of 6.7 ft (2.0 m) and  $ L_{r} $  of 137 ft (42 m). An extreme deflection limit might correspond to a

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_15_img_in_chart_box_149_761_717_1148.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_0.md -->

length-to-depth ratio of 24 or a length of 40 ft (12 m) for this member. Using the specified linear reduction between the plastic moment and the yield moment for lateral-torsional buckling, the plastic moment is reduced by only 7% for the 40 ft (12 m) length. In most practical designs with HSS where there is a moment gradient and the lateral-torsional buckling modification factor,  $ C_{b} $ , is larger than unity, the reduction will be nonexistent or insignificant.

Section F7.4 is included to account for the lateral-torsional buckling of very narrow box sections and box sections with plates thinner than HSS with the largest depth-to-width ratio. The provisions are from the 1989 AISC Specification (AISC, 1989), which were removed in subsequent editions where only HSS were addressed.

### F8. ROUND HSS

Round HSS are not subject to lateral-torsional buckling. The failure modes and postbuckling behavior of round HSS can be grouped into three categories (Sherman, 1992; Ziemian, 2010):

(a) For low values of D/t, a long plastic plateau occurs in the moment-rotation curve. The cross section gradually ovalizes, local wave buckles eventually form, and the moment resistance subsequently decays slowly. Flexural strength may exceed the theoretical plastic moment due to strain hardening.

(b) For intermediate values of D/t, the plastic moment is nearly achieved but a single local buckle develops and the flexural strength decays slowly with little or no plastic plateau region.

(c) For high values of D/t, multiple buckles form suddenly with very little ovalization and the flexural strength drops quickly.

The flexural strength provisions for round HSS reflect these three regions of behavior and are based upon five experimental programs involving hot-formed seamless pipe, electric-resistance-welded pipe, and fabricated tubing (Ziemian, 2010).

### F9. TEES AND DOUBLE ANGLES LOADED IN THE PLANE OF SYMMETRY

This section addresses both tees and double angles loaded in the plane of symmetry. Editions of the Specification prior to 2016 did not distinguish between tees and double angles and as a result, there were instances when double angles would appear to have less strength than two single angles. This Specification continues with the requirements implemented with the 2016 Specification (AISC, 2016) by providing separate provisions for tees and double angles. In those cases where double angles should have the same strength as two single angles, the provisions reference Section F10.

The lateral-torsional buckling strength of singly symmetric tee beams is given by a fairly complex formula (Ziemian, 2010). Equation F9-4 in the 2005 and 2010 AISC Specifications (AISC, 2005b, 2010) is a simplified formulation based on Kitipornchai and Trahair (1980). See also Ellifritt et al. (1992).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_1.md -->

For the limit state of lateral-torsional buckling when the stem of the member is in tension (that is, when the flange is in compression), Section F9.2 follows the general format for nominal flexural resistance (see Figure C-F1.2). The 2010 AISC Specification transitioned abruptly from the full plastic moment to the elastic buckling range. The plastic range then often extended for a considerable length of the beam. In the 2016 AISC Specification, a linear transition from full plastic moment,  $ M_{p} $ , to the yield moment,  $ M_{y} $ , as shown by the dashed line in Figure C-F9.1, was introduced to bring the members into conformance with the lateral-torsional buckling rules for I-shaped beams. This is continued in this Specification. It should be noted that the ratio of the plastic moment to the yield moment,  $ M_{p}/M_{y} $ , is in excess of 1.6, and is usually around 1.8 for tee and double-angle beams in flexure. The plastic moment value is limited to  $ 1.6M_{y} $  to preclude potential early yielding under service loading conditions. For double-angle legs in compression, the plastic moment is limited to  $ 1.5M_{y} $ , while for tee stems in compression the plastic moment value is limited to  $ M_{y} $ . There are no known studies that show what strength tee stems in compression can achieve. Thus, this conservative limit from previous editions of this Specification has been continued.

The WT6×7 (WT155×10.5) used for Figure C-F9.1 is an extreme case. For most shapes, the length,  $ L_{r} $ , is impractically long. Also shown in Figure C-F9.1 are two additional points: the square symbol is the length when the center deflection of the member equals  $ L_{b}/1,000 $  under its self-weight. The round symbol defines the length when the length-to-depth ratio equals 24.

The  $ C_{b} $  factor used for I-shaped beams is unconservative for tee beams with the stem in compression. For such cases,  $ C_{b} = 1.0 $  is appropriate. When beams are bent in reverse curvature, the portion with the stem in compression may control the lateral

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_16_img_in_chart_box_190_758_670_1151.jpg" ></div>

torsional buckling resistance even though the moments may be small relative to other portions of the unbraced length with  $ C_{b} \approx 1.0 $ . This is because the lateral-torsional buckling strength of a tee with the stem in compression may be only about one-fourth of the strength for the stem in tension. Because the buckling strength is sensitive to the moment diagram,  $ C_{b} $  has been conservatively taken as 1.0 in Section F9.2. In cases where the stem is in tension, connection details should be designed to minimize any end restraining moments that might cause the stem to be in compression.

The 2005 AISC Specification did not have provisions for the local buckling strength of the stems of tee sections and the legs of double-angle sections under a flexural compressive stress gradient. The Commentary to this section in the 2005 AISC Specification explained that the local buckling strength was accounted for in the equation for the lateral-torsional buckling limit state, Equation F9-4, when the unbraced length,  $ L_{b} $ , approached zero. While this was thought to be an acceptable approximation at the time, it led to confusion and to many questions by users of the Specification. For this reason, Section F9.4, "Local Buckling of Tee Stems in Flexural Compression," was added to provide an explicit set of formulas for the 2010 AISC Specification.

The derivation of these formulas is provided here to explain the changes. The classical formula for the elastic buckling of a rectangular plate is (Ziemian, 2010),

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{\pi^{2}Ek}{12\Big(1-\mathrm{v}^{2}\Big)\Big(\frac{b}{t}\Big)^{2}} $$ 

where

 $$ v = 0.3 \, (Poisson's ratio) $$ 

 $$ b/t=plate width-to-thickness ratio $$ 

 $$ k_{ 冮 }=plate buckling coefficient $$ 

For the stem of tee sections, the width-to-thickness ratio is equal to  $ d/t_{w} $ . The two rectangular plates in Figure C-F9.2 are fixed at the top, free at the bottom, and loaded, respectively, with a uniform and a linearly varying compressive stress. The corresponding plate buckling coefficients, k, are 1.33 and 1.61 (Figure 4.4, Ziemian, 2010). The graph in Figure C-F9.3 shows the general scheme used historically in developing the local buckling criteria in AISC Specifications. The ordinate is the critical stress divided by the yield stress, and the abscissa is a nondimensional width-to-thickness ratio,

 $$ \overline{\lambda}=\frac{b}{t}\sqrt{\frac{F_{y}}{E}}\sqrt{\frac{12\left(1-\mathbf{v}^{2}\right)}{\pi^{2}k}} $$ 

In the traditional scheme, it is assumed the critical stress is the yield stress,  $ F_{y} $ , as long as  $ \bar{\lambda} \leq 0.7 $ . Elastic buckling, governed by Equation C-F9-1, commences when  $ \bar{\lambda} = 1.24 $  and  $ F_{cr} = 0.65 F_{y} $ . Between these two points, the transition is assumed linear to account for initial deflections and residual stresses. While these assumptions are arbitrary empirical values, they have proven satisfactory. The curve in Figure C-F9.4 shows the graph of the formulas adopted for the stem of tee sections when these elements are subjected to flexural compression. The limiting width-to-thickness ratio up to which  $ F_{cr} = F_{y} $  is (using v = 0.3 and k = 1.61),

The elastic buckling range was assumed to be governed by the same equation as the local buckling of the flanges of a wide-flange beam bent about its minor axis, as given by Equation F6-4:

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{0.70E}{\left(\frac{d}{t_{w}}\right)^{2}} $$ 

The underlying plate buckling coefficient for this equation is k = 0.76, which is a very conservative assumption for tee stems in flexural compression. An extensive direct analysis was performed by Richard Kaehler and Benjamin Schafer of the AISC Committee on Specifications Task Committee 4, on the elastic plate stability of a rolled WT-beam under bending causing compression at the tip of the stem, and it was found that the appropriate value for the plate-buckling coefficient is k = 1.68, resulting in Equation F9-19:

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{\pi^{2}Ek}{12\Big(1-\mathbf{v}^{2}\Big)\Big(\frac{b}{t}\Big)^{2}}=\frac{1.52E}{\Big(\frac{d}{t_{w}}\Big)^{2}} $$ 

The transition point between the noncompact and slender range is

 $$ \left(\frac{d}{t_{w}}\right)_{r}=\lambda_{r}=1.52\sqrt{\frac{E}{F_{y}}} $$ 

as listed in Table B4.1b. Case 14.

The comparison between the web local buckling curves first introduced in the 2016 AISC Specification and continued in this edition, with the 2010 AISC Specification is illustrated in Figure C-F9.4.

Flexure about the y-axis of tees and double angles does not occur frequently and is not covered in this Specification. However, guidance is given here to address this condition. The yield limit state and the local buckling limit state of the flange can be checked by using Equations F6-1 through F6-3. Lateral-torsional buckling can conservatively be calculated by assuming the flange acts alone as a rectangular beam, using Equations F11-3 through F11-5. Alternately, an elastic critical moment given as

 $$ M_{e}=\frac{\pi}{L_{b}}\sqrt{EI_{x}GJ} $$ 

may be used in Equations F10-2 or F10-3 to obtain the nominal flexural strength.

### F10. SINGLE ANGLES

Flexural strength limits are established for the limit states of yielding, lateral-torsional buckling, and leg local buckling of single-angle beams. In addition to addressing the general case of unequal-leg single angles, the equal-leg angle is treated as a special case. Furthermore, bending of equal-leg angles about a geometric axis, an axis parallel to one of the legs, is addressed separately as it is a common case of angle bending.

The tips of an angle refer to the free edges of the two legs. In most cases of unrestrained bending, the flexural stresses at the two tips will have the same sign (tension or compression). For constrained bending about a geometric axis, the tip stresses will differ in sign. Provisions for both tension and compression at the tip should be checked, as appropriate, but in most cases it will be evident which controls.

Appropriate serviceability limits for single-angle beams need to also be considered. In particular, for longer members subjected to unrestrained bending, deflections are likely to control rather than lateral-torsional buckling or leg local buckling strength.

The provisions in this section follow the general format for nominal flexural resistance (see Figure C-F1.2). There is a region of full plastification, a linear transition to the yield moment, and a region of local buckling.

### 1. Yielding

The strength at full yielding is limited to 1.5 times the yield moment. This limit acts as a limit on the ratio of plastic moment to yield moment,  $ M_{p}/M_{y} $ , which can also be represented as Z/S. This ratio is also known as the shape factor. The limit in Equation F10-1 assures an upper-bound plastic moment for an angle that could be bent about any axis, in as much as these provisions are applicable to all flexural conditions. A 1.25 factor had been used in the past and was known to be a conservative value. Research (Earls and Galambos, 1997) has indicated that the 1.5 factor represents a better upper-bound value. Because the shape factor for angles is in excess of 1.5, the nominal strength,  $ M_{n} = 1.5M_{y} $ , for compact members is justified provided that instability does not control.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_6.md -->

### 2. Lateral-Torsional Buckling

Lateral-torsional buckling may limit the flexural strength of an unbraced single-angle beam. As illustrated in Figure C-F10.1, Equation F10-3 represents the elastic buckling portion with the maximum nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , equal to 75% of the theoretical buckling moment,  $ M_{cr} $ . Equation F10-2 represents the inelastic buckling transition expression between 0.75 $ M_{y} $  and 1.5 $ M_{y} $ . The maximum beam flexural strength,  $ M_{n} = 1.5M_{y} $ , will occur when the theoretical buckling moment,  $ M_{cr} $ , reaches or exceeds 7.7 $ M_{y} $ .  $ M_{y} $  is the moment at first yield in Equations F10-2 and F10-3, the same as the  $ M_{y} $  in Equation F10-1. These equations are modifications of those developed from the results of Australian research on single angles in flexure and on an analytical model consisting of two rectangular elements of length equal to the actual angle leg width minus one-half the thickness (AISC, 1975; Leigh and Lay, 1978, 1984; Madugula and Kennedy, 1985).

When bending is applied about one leg of a laterally unrestrained single angle, the angle will deflect laterally as well as in the bending direction. Its behavior can be evaluated by resolving the load and/or moments into principal axis components and determining the sum of these principal axis flexural effects. Subsection (i) of Section F10.2(2) is provided to simplify and expedite the calculations for this common situation with equal-leg angles. For such unrestrained bending of an equal-leg angle, the resulting maximum normal stress at the angle tip (in the direction of bending) will be approximately 25% greater than the calculated stress using the geometric axis section modulus. The value of  $ M_{cr} $  given by Equations F10-5a and F10-5b and the evaluation of  $ M_{y} $  using 0.80 of the geometric axis section modulus reflect bending about the inclined axis shown in Figure C-F10.2. Dumonteil (2009) compares the results using the geometric axis approach with that of the principal-axis approach for lateral-torsional buckling.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_16_img_in_chart_box_146_776_716_1154.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_7.md -->

The deflection calculated using the geometric axis moment of inertia has to be increased 82% to approximate the total deflection. Deflection has two components: a vertical component (in the direction of applied load) of 1.56 times the calculated value, and a horizontal component of 0.94 times the calculated value. The resultant total deflection is in the general direction of the minor principal axis bending of the angle (see Figure C-F10.2). These unrestrained bending deflections should be considered in evaluating serviceability and will often control the design over lateral-torsional buckling.

The horizontal component of deflection being approximately 60% of the vertical deflection means that the lateral restraining force required to achieve purely vertical deflection must be 60% of the applied load value (or produce a moment 60% of the applied value), which is very significant.

Lateral-torsional buckling is limited by  $ M_{cr} $  (Leigh and Lay, 1978, 1984) as defined in Equation F10-5a, which is based on

 $$ M_{cr}=\frac{2.33Eb^{4}t}{\left(1+3\cos^{2}\theta\right)\left(KL\right)^{2}}\left(\sqrt{\sin^{2}\theta+\frac{0.156\left(1+3\cos^{2}\theta\right)\left(KL\right)^{2}t^{2}}{b^{4}}}+\sin\theta\right)(C-F10-1) $$ 

(the general expression for the critical moment of an equal-leg angle) with  $ \theta = -45^{\circ} $  for the condition where the angle tip stress is compressive (see Figure C-F10.3). Lateral-torsional buckling can also limit the flexural strength of the cross section when the maximum angle tip stress is tensile from geometric axis flexure, especially with use of the flexural strength limits in Section F10.2. Using  $ \theta = 45^{\circ} $  in Equation C-F10-1, the resulting expression is Equation F10-5b with a +1 instead of -1 as the last term.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_16_img_in_image_box_150_769_710_1130.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_8.md -->

Stress at the tip of the angle leg parallel to the applied bending axis is of the same sign as the maximum stress at the tip of the other leg when the single angle is unrestrained. For an equal-leg angle this stress is about one-third of the maximum stress. It is only necessary to check the nominal bending strength based on the tip of the angle leg with the maximum stress when evaluating such an angle. If an angle is subjected to an axial compressive load, the flexural limits obtained from Section F10.2, item (2), cannot be used due to the inability to calculate a proper moment magnification factor for use in the interaction equations.

For unequal-leg angles and for equal-leg angles in compression without lateral-torsional restraint, the applied load or moment must be resolved into components along the two principal axes in all cases and design must be for biaxial bending using the interaction equations in Chapter H.

Under major-axis bending of single angles, Equation F10-4 in combination with Equations F10-2 and F10-3 control the available moment against overall lateral-torsional buckling of the angle. This is based on  $ M_{cr} $  given in Equation C-F10-1 with  $ \theta = 0^{\circ} $ .

Lateral-torsional buckling will reduce the stress below  $ 1.5M_{y} $  only for  $ M_{cr} < 7.7M_{y} $ . For an equal-leg angle bent about its major principal axis, this occurs for  $ L_{b}/t \geq 3,700C_{b}/F_{y} $ . If the  $ L_{b}t/b^{2} $  parameter is small (less than approximately  $ 0.44C_{b} $  for this case), local buckling will control the available moment and  $ M_{n} $  based on lateral-torsional buckling need not be evaluated. Local buckling must be checked using Section F10.3.

Lateral-torsional buckling about the major principal axis (w-axis) of an angle is controlled by  $ M_{cr} $  in Equation F10-4. The section property,  $ \beta_{w} $ , which is nonzero for unequal-leg angles reflects the location of the shear center relative to the principal axis of the section and the bending direction under uniform bending. Positive  $ \beta_{w} $  and

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_16_img_in_image_box_175_803_687_1140.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-F10.3. Equal-leg angle with general moment loading.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_9.md -->

maximum  $ M_{cr} $  occur when the shear center is in flexural compression while negative  $ \beta_{w} $  and minimum  $ M_{cr} $  occur when the shear center is in flexural tension (see Figure C-F10.4). This  $ \beta_{w} $  effect is consistent with the behavior of singly symmetric I-shaped beams, which are more stable when the compression flange is larger than the tension flange.

For reverse curvature bending, part of the unbraced length has positive  $ \beta_{w} $ , while the remainder has negative  $ \beta_{w} $ ; conservatively, the negative value is assigned for that entire unbraced segment.

The factor  $ \beta_{w} $  is essentially independent of angle thickness (less than 1% variation from mean value) and is primarily a function of the leg widths. The average values shown in Table C-F10.1 may be used for design.

### 3. Leg Local Buckling

The b/t limits were modified for the 2010 AISC Specification to be more representative of flexural limits rather than using those for single angles under uniform compression. Typically, the flexural stresses will vary along the leg length permitting the use of the stress limits given. Even for the geometric axis flexure case, which produces uniform compression along one leg, use of these limits will provide a conservative value when compared to the results reported in Earls and Galambos (1997).

### F11. RECTANGULAR BARS AND ROUNDS

The provisions in Section F11 apply to solid bars with round and rectangular cross section. The prevalent limit state for such members is the attainment of the full plastic moment,  $ M_{p} $ . The exception is the lateral-torsional buckling of rectangular bars where the depth is larger than the width. The requirements for design are identical to those given in Table A-F1.1 in the 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b) and the same as those in use since the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b). Because the shape factor, Z/S, for a rectangular cross section is 1.5 and for a round section is 1.7, consideration must be given to serviceability issues such as excessive deflection or permanent deformation under service-load conditions.

### F12. UNSYMMETRICAL SHAPES

When the design engineer encounters beams that do not contain an axis of symmetry, or any other shape for which there are no provisions in the other sections of Chapter F, the stresses are to be limited by the yield stress or the elastic buckling stress. The stress distribution and/or the elastic buckling stress must be determined from principles of structural mechanics, textbooks, or handbooks, such as the SSRC Guide (Ziemian, 2010), papers in journals, or finite element analyses. Alternatively, the designer can avoid the problem by selecting cross sections from among the many choices addressed in the previous sections of Chapter F.

### F13. PROPORTIONS OF BEAMS AND GIRDERS

### 1. Strength Reductions for Members with Bolt Holes in the Tension Flange

Historically, provisions for proportions of rolled beams and girders with bolt holes in the tension flange were based upon either a percentage reduction independent of material strength or a calculated relationship between the tensile rupture and tensile

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_11.md -->

yield strengths of the flange, with resistance factors or safety factors included in the calculation. In both cases, the provisions were developed based upon tests of steel with a specified minimum yield stress of 36 ksi (250 MPa) or less.

More recent tests (Dexter and Altstadt, 2004; Yuan et al., 2004) indicate that the flexural strength on the net section is better predicted by comparison of the quantities  $ F_{y}A_{fg} $  and  $ F_{u}A_{fn} $ , with a slight adjustment when the ratio of  $ F_{y} $  to  $ F_{u} $  exceeds 0.8. If the bolt holes remove enough material to affect the member strength, the critical stress is adjusted from  $ F_{y} $  to  $ F_{u}A_{fn}/A_{fg} $  and this value is conservatively applied to the elastic section modulus,  $ S_{x} $ .

The resistance factor and safety factor used throughout this chapter,  $ \phi = 0.90 $  and  $ \Omega = 1.67 $ , are those normally applied for the limit state of yielding. In the case of rupture of the tension flange due to the presence of bolt holes, the provisions of this chapter continue to apply the same resistance and safety factors. Because the effect of Equation F13-1 is to multiply the elastic section modulus by a stress that is always less than the yield stress, it can be shown that this resistance and safety factor always give conservative results when  $ Z/S \leq 1.2 $ ; it can also be shown to be conservative when Z/S > 1.2 and a more accurate model for the rupture strength is used (Geschwindner, 2010a).

### 2. Proportioning Limits for I-Shaped Members

The provisions of this section were taken directly from Appendix G, Section G1, of the 1999 AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b) and have been the same since the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b). They have been part of the plate girder design requirements since 1963 and are derived from Basler and Thürlimann (1963). The web depth-to-thickness limitations are provided to prevent the flange from buckling into the web. Equation F13-4 was slightly modified from the corresponding Equation A-G1-2 in the 1999 AISC LRFD Specification to recognize the change in the definition of residual stress from a constant 16.5 ksi (110 MPa) to 30% of the yield stress in the 2005 AISC Specification, as shown by the following derivation:

 $$ \frac{0.48E}{\sqrt{F_{y}\left(F_{y}+16.5\right)}}\approx\frac{0.48E}{\sqrt{F_{y}\left(F_{y}+0.3F_{y}\right)}}=\frac{0.42E}{F_{y}} $$ 

### 3. Cover Plates

Cover plates need not extend the entire length of the beam or girder. The end connection between the cover plate and beam must be designed to resist the full force in the cover plate at the theoretical cutoff point. The end force in a cover plate on a beam whose required strength exceeds the available yield strength,  $ \phi M_{y} = \phi F_{y} S_{x} $  (LRFD) or  $ M_{y} / \Omega = F_{y} S_{x} / \Omega $  (ASD), of the combined shape can be determined by an elastic-plastic analysis of the cross section but can conservatively be taken as the full yield strength of the cover plate for LRFD or the full yield strength of the cover plate divided by 1.5 for ASD. The forces in a cover plate on a beam whose required strength does not exceed the available yield strength of the combined section can be determined using the elastic distribution, MQ/I.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_12.md -->

The requirements for minimum weld lengths on the sides of cover plates at each end reflect uneven stress distribution in the welds due to shear lag in short connections.

The requirement that the area of cover plates on bolted girders be limited was removed for the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016) because there was no justification to treat bolted girders any differently than welded girders when considering the size of the cover plate.

# CHAPTER G DESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR SHEAR

Chapter G includes the following major additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Provisions have been added to permit tension field action in end panels.

### G1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Chapter G applies to webs of I-shaped members subjected to shear in the plane of the web, single angles, tees, HSS, and box sections. It also applies to flanges of I-shaped members and tees subjected to shear in the y-direction.

### G2. I-SHAPED MEMBERS AND CHANNELS

Two shear strength prediction methods are presented. The method in Section G2.1 accounts for the web shear post-buckling strength through Rotated Stress Field Theory in members with unstiffened webs and members with transverse stiffeners spaced at 3h or smaller. The method of Sections G2.2 and G2.3 accounts for the web shear post-buckling strength through tension field action in interior and end panels, respectively, of members with stiffeners spaced at 3h or smaller. Transverse stiffeners, or components providing equivalent restraint of out-of-plane deformation of the web, may be necessary at the member ends and at supports.

### 1. Shear Strength of Webs

Section G2.1 addresses the shear strength of I-shaped members subjected to shear and bending in the plane of the web. The provisions in this section apply when postbuckling strength develops due to web stress redistribution.

The nominal shear strength of a web is defined by Equation G2-1, a product of the shear yield force,  $ 0.6F_{y}A_{w} $ , and the shear post-buckling strength reduction factor,  $ C_{v1} $ . The formulation is based on the Rotated Stress Field Theory (Höglund, 1997), which includes post-buckling strength due to web stress redistribution in members with or without transverse stiffeners. Höglund presented equations for members with rigid end posts (in essence, vertical beams spanning between flanges) and nonrigid end posts, such as regular bearing stiffeners. The latter equation was written in the form of the familiar  $ C_{v} $  formulation from prior AISC Specifications and modified slightly for use in Section G2.1 (Daley et al., 2016; Studer et al., 2015).

The provisions in Section G2.1(a) for rolled I-shaped members with  $ h/t_{w} \leq 2.24\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $  are similar to the 1999 and earlier LRFD Specifications, with the exception that  $ \phi $  has been increased from 0.90 to 1.00 (with a corresponding decrease of the safety factor from 1.67 to 1.50), thus making these provisions consistent with the 1989 provisions for allowable stress design (AISC, 1989). The value of  $ \phi $  of 1.00 is justified by comparison with experimental test data and recognizes the minor consequences of shear yielding, as compared to tension and compression yielding, on the overall

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_14.md -->

performance of rolled I-shaped members. This increase is applicable only to the shear yielding limit state of rolled I-shaped members.

Section G2.1(b) uses the shear post-buckling strength reduction factor,  $ C_{v1} $ , shown in Figure C-G2.1. The curve for  $ C_{v1} $  has two segments, whereas prior to 2016, Section G2.1 provisions for  $ C_{v} $  had three segments (AISC, 2010).

For webs with  $ h/t_{w} \leq 1.10 \sqrt{k_{v} E / F_{yw}} $ , the nominal shear strength,  $ V_{n} $ , is based on shear yielding of the web, with  $ C_{v1} = 1.0 $  as given by Equation G2-3. This  $ h/t_{w} $  yielding limit was determined by slightly increasing the limit from Höglund (1997) to match the previous yielding limit, which was based on Cooper et al. (1978).

When  $ h/t_{w} > 1.10\sqrt{k_{v}E/F_{yw}} $ , the web shear strength is based on the shear buckling and subsequent post-buckling strength of a web with nonrigid end posts. The resulting strength reduction factor,  $ C_{v1} $ , given by Equation G2-4, was determined by dividing the Höglund (1997) buckling plus post-buckling strength by the shear yield strength and increasing that ratio slightly to better match experimental measurements (Daley et al., 2016; Studer et al., 2015).

The plate buckling coefficient,  $ k_{\nu} $ , for panels subjected to pure shear having simple supports on all four sides is given by the following (Ziemian, 2010):

 $$ k_{v}=\left\{\begin{aligned}&4.00+\frac{5.34}{\left(a/h\right)^{2}}\text{for}a/h\leq1\\ &5.34+\frac{4.00}{\left(a/h\right)^{2}}\text{for}a/h>1\end{aligned}\right\} $$ 

For simplicity, these equations have been simplified without loss of accuracy and were first introduced in AASHTO (2014) as the following equation, which is based on Vincent (1969):

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_16_img_in_chart_box_241_823_689_1166.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-G2.1. Shear buckling coefficient for Fy = 50 ksi (345 MPa).</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_15.md -->

 $$ k_{v}=5+\frac{5}{\left(a/h\right)^{2}} $$ 

The plate buckling coefficient,  $ k_{v} $ , is 5.34 for web panels with an aspect ratio, a/h, exceeding 3.0. This value is slightly larger than the value of 5.0 used in AISC Specifications prior to 2016, and is consistent with Höglund's developments (Höglund, 1997).

AISC Specifications before 2016 limited a/h to  $ \left[\frac{260}{(h/t_{w})}\right]^{2} $ , which was based on the following statement by Basler (1961): "In the range of high web slenderness ratios, the stiffener spacing should not be arbitrarily large. Although the web might still be sufficient to carry the shear, the distortions could be almost beyond control in fabrication and under load." The experimental evidence shows that I-shaped members develop the calculated resistances without the need for this restriction (White and Barker, 2008; White et al., 2008). Furthermore, for a/h > 1.5, Equation F13-4 limits the maximum  $ h/t_{w} $  to 232 for  $ F_{y} = 50 $  ksi, and for  $ a/h \leq 1.5 $ , Equation F13-3 limits the web slenderness to 289 for  $ F_{y} = 50 $  ksi. These limits are considered sufficient to limit distortions during fabrication and handling. The engineer should be aware of the fact that sections with highly slender webs are more apt to be controlled by the web local yielding, web local crippling, and/or web compression buckling limit states of Sections J10.2, J10.3, and J10.5. Therefore, these limit states may limit the maximum practical web slenderness in some situations.

### 2. Shear Strength of Interior Web Panels with  $ a/h \leq 3 $  Considering Tension Field Action

The panels of the web of a built-up member, bounded on the top and bottom by the flanges and on each side by transverse stiffeners, are capable of carrying loads far in excess of their web elastic buckling strength. Upon reaching the theoretical web elastic buckling strength, slight lateral displacements of the web will have developed. These deformations are of no structural significance, because other means are still present to provide further shear resistance.

When transverse stiffeners are properly spaced and are stiff enough to resist out-of-plane movement of the post-buckled web, significant diagonal tension fields form in the web panels prior to the shear yielding resistance. The web in effect acts like a Pratt truss composed of tension diagonals and compression verticals that are stabilized by the transverse stiffeners. This effective Pratt truss furnishes the strength to resist applied shear forces unaccounted for by the elastic buckling theory, but the enhanced resistance due to tension field forces is reduced when the panel aspect ratio becomes large. For this reason, the inclusion of tension field action is not permitted when a/h exceeds 3.0.

Analytical methods based on tension field action have been developed (Basler and Thürlimann, 1963; Basler, 1961) and corroborated in an extensive program of tests (Basler et al., 1960). Equation G2-7 is based on this research. The second term in the bracket represents the relative increase of the panel shear strength due to tension field action. The merits of Equation G2-7 relative to various alternative representations of web shear resistance are evaluated and Equation G2-7 is recommended for

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_16.md -->

characterization of the shear strength of stiffened interior web panels in White and Barker (2008).

AISC Specifications prior to 2005 required explicit consideration of the interaction between the flexural and shear strengths when the web is designed using tension field action. White et al. (2008) show that the interaction between the shear and flexural resistances may be neglected by using a smaller tension field action shear strength for beams with  $ 2A_{w}/\left(A_{ft} + A_{fc}\right) > 2.5 $  or  $ h/b_{ft} > 6.0 $  or  $ h/b_{fc} > 6 $ . Section G2.2 disallows the use of the traditional complete tension field action, Equation G2-7, for I-shaped members with relatively small flange-to-web proportions identified by these limits. For cases where these limits are violated, Equation G2-8 gives an applicable reduced tension field action resistance referred to as the "true Basler" tension field resistance. The true Basler resistance is based on the development of only a partial tension field, whereas Equation G2-7 is based on the development of a theoretical complete tension field. Similar limits are specified in AASHTO (2014).

Consideration of shear and bending interaction, which was required prior to 2010 (AISC, 2010), is not required because the shear and flexural resistances can be calculated with a sufficient margin of safety without considering this effect (White et al., 2008; Daley et al., 2016).

### 3. Shear Strength of End Web Panels with  $ a/h \leq 3 $  Considering Tension Field Action

The key requirement in the development of tension field action for the interior panels of built-up I-shaped members is the ability of the stiffeners to provide sufficient flexural rigidity to stabilize the web along their length. In the case of end panels, there is a panel only on one side. The anchorage of the tension field was, thus, thought to be limited and its contribution had been neglected since the shear strength equation with tension-field action was introduced in the Specification in 1961 (AISC, 1961). Recent testing of large-size steel girders shows, however, that this design approach for end panels is very conservative (Kim and Uang, 2021). Based on results from both testing and finite element simulation, it is shown that tension field action actually can develop by forming plastic hinges in the flanges and bearing stiffeners shown in Figure C-G2.2. Equation G2-12 has the same format as Equation G2-7, except that a parameter  $ \beta_{v} $  is included in the second term in the bracket in Equation G2-12 to reflect the contribution from partial tension field action. The  $ \beta_{v} $  term given by Equation G2-13 requires that the plastic moments of the flanges and bearing stiffeners at the support be computed. A small portion of the web with a width  $ d_{e} $  is included in the sections to compute these plastic moments (see Figure C-G2.3). When the web extends beyond the support, the overhang portion of the web should not be taken larger than  $ 0.84t_{w}\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ ; it is assumed that the portion beyond this length is ineffective due to flexural buckling when a plastic hinge is formed at location J in Figure C-G2.2. For interior panels, two equations (Equations G2-7 and G2-8) are provided, depending on the flange areas relative to the web area. Such distinction is not needed for end panels because the effect of flange area is directly reflected in the value of  $ M_{pf} $ . Equation G2-12 is developed for doubly symmetric members with equal flange areas. When the top and bottom flanges are not the same,  $ M_{pf} $  is based on the smaller value from the top or bottom flange.

### 4. Transverse Stiffeners

Numerous studies (Horne and Grayson, 1983; Rahal and Harding, 1990a, 1990b, 1991; Stanway et al., 1993, 1996; Lee et al., 2002b; Xie and Chapman, 2003; Kim et al., 2007; Kim and White, 2014) have shown that transverse stiffeners in I-girders designed for shear post-buckling strength, including tension field action, are loaded predominantly in bending due to the restraint they provide to lateral deflection of the web. Generally, there is evidence of some axial compression in the transverse stiffeners due to the tension field, but even in the most slender web plates permitted by this Specification, the effect of the axial compression transmitted from the post-buckled web plate is typically minor compared to the lateral loading effect. Therefore, the transverse stiffener area requirement from prior AISC Specifications is no longer specified. Rather, the demands on the stiffener flexural rigidity are increased in situations where the post-buckling resistance of the web is relied upon. Equation G2-17 is the same requirement as specified in AASHTO (2014).

### G3. SINGLE ANGLES AND TEES

Shear stresses in single-angle members and tee stems are the result of the gradient of the bending moment along the length (flexural shear) and the torsional moment.

For angles, the maximum elastic stress due to flexural shear is

 $$ f_{v}=\frac{1.5V_{b}}{bt} $$ 

where  $ V_{b} $  is the component of the shear force parallel to the angle leg with width b and thickness t. The stress is constant throughout the thickness and it should be calculated for both legs to determine the maximum. The coefficient 1.5 is the calculated value for equal-leg angles loaded along one of the principal axes. For equal-leg angles loaded along one of the geometric axes, this factor is 1.35. Factors between these limits may be calculated conservatively from  $ V_{b}Q/It $  to determine the maximum stress at the neutral axis. Alternatively, if only flexural shear is considered, a uniform flexural shear stress in the leg of  $ V_{b}/bt $  may be used due to inelastic material behavior and stress redistribution.

If the angle is not laterally braced against twist, a torsional moment is produced equal to the applied transverse load times the perpendicular distance, e, to the shear center, which is at the point of intersection of the centerlines of the two legs. Torsional moments are resisted by two types of shear behavior: pure torsion (St. Venant torsion) and warping torsion (Seaburg and Carter, 1997). The shear stresses due to restrained warping are small compared to the St. Venant torsion (typically less than 20%) and they can be neglected for practical purposes. The applied torsional moment is then resisted by pure shear stresses that are constant along the width of the leg (except for localized regions at the toe of the leg), and the maximum value can be approximated by

 $$ f_{v}=\frac{M_{T}t}{J}=\frac{3M_{T}}{At} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_19.md -->

where

 $$ A_{ 冚 }=area of angle,in.^{2}(mm^{2}) $$ 

J = torsional constant [approximated by  $ \sum(bt^{3}/3) $  when precomputed value is unavailable], in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

 $$ M_{T}=\mathrm{torsional\ moment,\ kip-in.\ (N-mm)} $$ 

For a study of the effects of warping, see Gjelsvik (1981). Torsional moments from laterally unrestrained transverse loads also produce warping normal stresses that are superimposed on the bending stresses. However, because the warping strength of single angles is relatively small, this additional bending effect, just like the warping shear effect, can be neglected for practical purposes.

### G4. RECTANGULAR HSS, BOX SECTIONS, AND OTHER SINGLY AND DOUBLY SYMMETRIC MEMBERS

The shear strength of rectangular HSS and box-section webs is taken as the shear yield strength if web slenderness,  $ h/t_{w} $ , does not exceed the yielding limit, or the shear buckling strength. Post-buckling strength from Section G2.1 is not included due to lack of experimental verification.

### G5. ROUND HSS

Little information is available on round HSS subjected to transverse shear; therefore, the recommendations are based on local buckling of cylinders due to torsion. However, because torsion is generally constant along the member length and transverse shear usually has a gradient, it is recommended to take the critical stress for transverse shear as 1.3 times the critical stress for torsion (Brockenbrough and Johnston, 1981; Ziemian, 2010). The torsion equations apply over the full length of the member, but for transverse shear it is reasonable to use the length between the points of maximum and zero shear force. Only thin HSS may require a reduction in the shear strength based upon first shear yield.

In the equation for the nominal shear strength,  $ V_{n} $ , it is assumed that the shear stress at the neutral axis, VQ/Ib, is at  $ F_{cr} $ . For a thin round section with radius R and thickness t,  $ I = \pi R^{3} t $ ,  $ Q = 2 R^{2} t $ , and b = 2t. This gives the stress at the centroid as  $ V / \pi R t $ , in which the denominator is recognized as half the area of the round HSS.

### G6. DOUBLY SYMMETRIC AND SINGLY SYMMETRIC MEMBERS SUBJECTED TO MINOR-AXIS SHEAR

The minor-axis shear strength of I-shaped members and channel flanges is the shear yield strength if flange slenderness,  $ b_{f}/2t_{f} $  for I-shapes or  $ b_{f}/t_{f} $  for channels, does not exceed the limit  $ 1.10\sqrt{k_{v}E/F_{y}} $ , or the shear buckling strength, otherwise. Because shear post-buckling strength is not included for these cases due to lack of experimental verification, the shear buckling coefficient,  $ C_{v2} $ , from Section G2.2 is used. The plate buckling coefficient,  $ k_{v} $ , is 1.2 due to the presence of a free edge.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_20.md -->

The maximum plate slenderness of all rolled shapes is  $ b_{f}/t_{f}=b_{f}/2t_{f}=13.8 $ . The lower bound of  $ 1.10\sqrt{k_{v}E/F_{y}} $ , computed using  $ F_{y}=100 $  ksi, is

 $$ 1.10\sqrt{1.2(29,000ksi)/100ksi}=20.5 $$ 

The maximum plate slenderness does not exceed the lower bound of the yielding limit; therefore,  $ C_{v2} = 1.0 $ , except for built-up shapes with very slender flanges.

### G7. BEAMS AND GIRDERS WITH WEB OPENINGS

Web openings may be used to accommodate various mechanical, electrical, and other systems. Strength limit states, including local buckling of the compression flange or of the web, local buckling or yielding of the tee-shaped compression zone above or below the opening, lateral buckling and moment-shear interaction, or serviceability may control the design of a flexural member with web openings. The location, size, and number of openings are important and empirical limits for them have been identified. One general procedure for assessing these effects and the design of any needed reinforcement for both steel and composite beams is given in the ASCE Specification for Structural Steel Beams with Web Openings (ASCE, 1999), with background information provided in AISC Design Guide 2, Steel and Composite Beams with Web Openings (Darwin, 1990), and in ASCE (1992a, 1992b).

# CHAPTER H DESIGN OF MEMBERS FOR COMBINED FORCES AND TORSION

Chapter H includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Provisions have been added for hollow structural sections (HSS) subjected to combined forces to include biaxial bending and shear.

(2) Section H4 has clarified that the holes being considered are bolt holes.

Chapters D, E, F, and G of this Specification address members subjected to only one type of force: axial tension, axial compression, flexure, and shear, respectively, or to multiple forces that can be treated as only one type of force. This chapter addresses members subjected to a combination of two or more of these individual forces, as well as possibly by additional forces due to torsion. The provisions fall into two categories: (a) the majority of the cases that can be handled by an interaction equation involving sums of ratios of required strengths to available strengths; and (b) cases where the stresses due to the applied forces are added and compared to limiting buckling or yield stresses. Designers will have to consult the provisions of Sections H2 and H3 only in rarely occurring cases.

### H1. DOUBLY AND SINGLY SYMMETRIC MEMBERS SUBJECTED TO FLEXURE AND AXIAL FORCE

This section contains design provisions for doubly symmetric and singly symmetric members under combined flexure and compression, and under combined flexure and tension. The provisions of this section apply typically to rolled wide-flange shapes, channels, tees, round, square, and rectangular HSS, solid rounds, squares, rectangles, or diamonds, and any of the many possible combinations of doubly or singly symmetric shapes fabricated from plates and/or shapes by welding or bolting. The interaction equations accommodate flexure about one or both principal axes as well as axial compression or tension. The restriction on the ratio  $ I_{yc}/I_{y} $  that had been included in Section H1.1 of Specifications prior to 2016 was found to be unnecessary and was removed in that edition.

### 1. Doubly and Singly Symmetric Members Subjected to Flexure and Compression

In 1923, the first AISC Specification (AISC, 1923) required that the stresses due to flexure and compression be added and that the sum not exceed the allowable value. An interaction equation appeared first in the 1936 AISC Specification (AISC, 1936), stating "Members subject to both axial and bending stresses shall be so proportioned that the quantity  $ f_{a}/F_{a} + f_{b}/F_{b} $  shall not exceed unity," in which  $ F_{a} $  and  $ F_{b} $  are, respectively, the axial and flexural allowable stresses permitted by this Specification, and  $ f_{a} $  and  $ f_{b} $  are the corresponding stresses due to the axial force and the bending.

moment, respectively. This linear interaction equation was in force until the 1961 AISC Specification (AISC, 1961), when it was modified to account for frame stability and for the  $ P-\delta $  effect, that is, the secondary bending between the ends of the members (Equation C-H1-1). The  $ P-\Delta $  effect, that is, the second-order bending moment due to story sway, was not accommodated.

 $$ \frac{f_{a}}{F_{a}}+\frac{C_{m}f_{b}}{\left(1-\frac{f_{a}}{F_{e}^{\prime}}\right)F_{b}}\leq1.0 $$ 

The allowable axial stress,  $ F_{a} $ , was usually determined for an effective length that is larger than the actual member length for moment frames. The term  $ 1/(1-f_{a}/F_{e}^{\prime}) $  is the amplification of the interspan moment due to member deflection multiplied by the axial force (the  $ P-\delta $  effect).  $ C_{m} $  accounts for the effect of the moment gradient. This interaction equation was part of all the subsequent editions of the AISC ASD Specifications from 1961 through 1989.

A new approach to the interaction of flexural and axial forces was introduced in the 1986 AISC Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 1986). The following is an explanation of the thinking behind the interaction curves used. The equations,

 $$ \frac{P}{P_{y}}+\frac{8}{9}\frac{M_{pc}}{M_{p}}=1\quad for\frac{P}{P_{y}}\geq0.2 $$ 

 $$ \frac{P}{2P_{y}}+\frac{M_{pc}}{M_{p}}=1\ \mathrm{for}\ \frac{P}{P_{y}}<0.2 $$ 

define the lower-bound curve for the interaction of the nondimensional axial strength,  $ P/P_{y} $ , and flexural strength,  $ M_{pc}/M_{p} $ , for compact wide-flange stub-columns bent about their x-axis. The cross section is assumed to be fully yielded in tension and compression. The symbol  $ M_{pc} $  is the plastic moment strength of the cross section in the presence of an axial force, P. The curve representing Equations C-H1-2 almost overlaps the analytically exact curve for the major-axis bending of a W8×31(W200×46.1) cross section (see Figure C-H1.1). The major-axis bending equations for the exact yield capacity of a wide-flange shape (ASCE, 1971) are as follows:

For  $ 0 \leq \frac{P}{P_{y}} \leq \frac{t_{w}(d - 2t_{f})}{A} $  (for the plastic neutral axis in the web)



 $$ \frac{M_{pc}}{M_{p}}=1-\frac{A^{2}\left(\frac{P}{P_{y}}\right)^{2}}{4t_{w}Z_{x}} $$ 

 $$ \frac{t_{w}\left(d-2t_{f}\right)}{A}<\frac{P}{P_{y}}\leq1\text{(for the plastic neutral axis in the flange)} $$ 

 $$ \frac{M_{pc}}{M_{p}}=\frac{A\left(1-\frac{P}{P_{y}}\right)}{2Z_{x}}\left[d-\frac{A\left(1-\frac{P}{P_{y}}\right)}{2b_{f}}\right] $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_23.md -->

For major-axis bending, an equation approximating the average yield strength of wide-flange shapes when  $ P \geq 0.15P_{y} $  is given as

 $$ \frac{M_{pc}}{M_{p}}=1.18\left(1-\frac{P}{P_{y}}\right)\leq1 $$ 

When  $ P < 0.15P_{y} $ ,  $ M_{pc} $  may be taken as  $ M_{p} $ .

The curves in Figure C-H1.2 show the exact and approximate yield interaction curves for wide-flange shapes bent about the y-axis, and the exact curves for the solid rectangular and round shapes. It is evident that the lower-bound AISC interaction curves are very conservative for these shapes.

The idea of portraying the strength of stub beam-columns was extended to actual beam-columns with actual lengths by normalizing the required flexural strength,  $ M_{u} $ , of the beam by the nominal strength of a beam without axial force,  $ M_{n} $ , and the required axial strength,  $ P_{u} $ , by the nominal strength of a column without bending moment,  $ P_{n} $ . This rearrangement results in a translation and rotation of the original stub-column interaction curve, as seen in Figure C-H1.3.

The normalized equations corresponding to the beam-column with length effects included are shown as Equation C-H1-5:

 $$ \frac{P_{u}}{P_{n}}+\frac{8}{9}\frac{M_{u}}{M_{n}}=1\ \mathrm{f o r}\frac{P_{u}}{P_{n}}\geq0.2 $$ 

 $$ \frac{P_{u}}{2P_{n}}+\frac{M_{u}}{M_{n}}=1\ \mathrm{f o r}\frac{P_{u}}{P_{n}}<0.2 $$

The interaction equations are designed to be very versatile. The terms in the denominator fix the endpoints of the interaction curve. The nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , is determined by the appropriate provisions from Chapter F. It encompasses the limit states of yielding, lateral-torsional buckling, flange local buckling, and web local buckling.

The axial term,  $ P_{n} $ , is governed by the provisions of Chapter E, and it can accommodate nonslender or slender element columns, as well as the limit states of major- and minor-axis buckling, and torsional and flexural-torsional buckling. Furthermore,  $ P_{n} $

is calculated for the applicable effective length of the column to take care of frame stability effects, if the procedures of Appendix 7, Section 7.2, are used to determine the required moments and axial forces. These required moments and axial forces must include the amplification due to second-order effects.

The utility of the interaction equations is further enhanced by the fact that they also permit the consideration of biaxial bending without the presence of axial load.

### 2. Doubly and Singly Symmetric Members Subjected to Flexure and Tension

Section H1.1 considers the most frequently occurring cases in design: members under flexure and axial compression. Section H1.2 addresses the less frequent cases of flexure and axial tension. Because axial tension increases the bending stiffness of the member to some extent, Section H1.2 permits the increase of  $ C_{b} $  in Chapter F. Thus, when the bending term is controlled by lateral-torsional buckling, the moment gradient factor,  $ C_{b} $ , is increased by

 $$ \sqrt{1+\frac{\alpha P_{r}}{P_{ey}}} $$ 

For the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), this multiplier was altered slightly as shown here to use the same constant,  $ \alpha $ , as is used throughout the Specification when results at the ultimate strength level are required.

### 3. Doubly Symmetric Rolled Compact Members Subjected to Single-Axis Flexure and Compression

For doubly symmetric wide-flange sections with moment applied about the x-axis, the bilinear interaction Equation C-H1-5 is conservative for cases where the axial limit state is out-of-plane buckling and the flexural limit state is lateral-torsional buckling (Ziemian, 2010). Because this condition is common in building structures, the provisions of this section may be quite useful to the designer and lead to a more economical structure than solutions using Section H1.1. Section H1.3 gives an optional equation for checking the out-of-plane resistance of such beam-columns.

The two curves labeled Equation H1-1 (out-of-plane) and Equation H1-3 (out-of-plane) in Figure C-H1.4 illustrate the difference between the bilinear and the parabolic interaction equations for out-of-plane resistance for the case of a W27×84 (W690×125) beam-column,  $ L_{b}=10~ft~(3.1~m) $  and  $ F_{y}=50~ksi~(345~MPa) $ , subjected to a linearly varying major-axis moment with zero moment at one end and maximum moment at the other end ( $ C_{b}=1.67 $ ). In addition, the figure shows the in-plane bilinear strength interaction for this member obtained from Equation H1-1. Note that the resistance term,  $ C_{b}M_{cx} $ , may be larger than  $ \phi_{b}M_{p} $  in LRFD or  $ M_{p}/\Omega_{b} $  in ASD. The smaller ordinate from the out-of-plane and in-plane resistance curves is the controlling strength.

Equation H1-3 is developed from the following fundamental form for the out-of-plane lateral-torsional buckling strength of doubly symmetric I-section members. For LRFD,

 $$ \left(\frac{M_{u}}{C_{b}\phi_{b}M_{nx(C_{b}=1)}}\right)^{2}\leq\left(1-\frac{P_{u}}{\phi_{c}P_{ny}}\right)\left(1-\frac{P_{u}}{\phi_{c}P_{ez}}\right) $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_26.md -->

Equation H1-3 is obtained by substituting a lower bound of 2.0 for the ratio of the elastic torsional buckling resistance to the out-of-plane nominal flexural buckling resistance,  $ P_{ez}/P_{ny} $ , for W-shape members with  $ L_{cy}=L_{cz} $ . The 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b) assumed an upper bound,  $ P_{ez}/P_{ny}=\infty $ , in Equation C-H1-6 in the development of Equation H1-3 which led to some cases where the out-of-plane strength was overestimated. In addition, the fact that the nominal out-of-plane flexural resistance term,  $ C_{b}M_{nx}(C_{b}=1) $ , may be larger than  $ M_{p} $  was not apparent in the 2005 AISC Specification. The changes that were implemented for the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010) continue to be applicable for this Specification.

The relationship between Equations H1-1 and H1-3 is further illustrated in Figures C-H1.5 (for LRFD) and C-H1.6 (for ASD). The curves relate the required axial force, P (ordinate), and the required bending moment, M (abscissa), when the interaction Equations H1-1 and H1-3 are equal to unity. The positive values of P are compression and the negative values are tension. The curves are for a 10-ft- (3.1-m-) long W16×26 (W410×38.8)  $ [F_{y}=50\ ksi\ (345\ MPa)] $  member subjected to uniform major-axis bending,  $ C_{b}=1 $ . The solid curve is for in-plane behavior, that is, lateral bracing prevents lateral-torsional buckling. The dotted curve represents Equation H1-1 for the case when there are no lateral braces between the ends of the beam-column. In the region of the tensile axial force, the curve is modified by the term

 $$ \sqrt{1+\frac{\alpha P_{r}}{P_{ey}}} $$ 

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_16_img_in_chart_box_207_691_656_1108.jpg" ></div>

as permitted in Section H1.2. The dashed curve is Equation H1-3 for the case of axial compression, and it is taken as the lower bound determined using Equation C-H1-6 with  $ P_{ez}/P_{ny} $  taken equal to infinity for the case of axial tension. For a given compressive or tensile axial force, Equations H1-3 and C-H1-6 allow a larger bending moment over most of their applicable range.

### H2. UNSYMMETRIC AND OTHER MEMBERS SUBJECTED TO FLEXURE AND AXIAL FORCE

The provisions of Section H1 apply to beam-columns with cross sections that are either doubly or singly symmetric. However, there are many cross sections that are unsymmetrical, such as unequal-leg angles and any number of possible fabricated sections. For these situations, the interaction equations of Section H1 may not be appropriate. The linear interaction,

 $$ \left|\frac{f_{ra}}{F_{ca}}+\frac{f_{rbw}}{F_{cbw}}+\frac{f_{rbz}}{F_{cbz}}\right|\leq1.0 $$ 

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_16_img_in_chart_box_134_551_730_1026.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_28.md -->

provides a conservative and simple way to deal with such problems. The lower case stresses, f, are the required axial and flexural stresses computed by elastic analysis for the applicable loads, including second-order effects where appropriate, and the upper case stresses, F, are the available stresses corresponding to the limit state of yielding or buckling. The subscripts r and c refer to the required and available stresses, respectively, while the subscripts w and z refer to the principal axes of the unsymmetric cross section. This Specification leaves the option to the designer to use the Section H2 interaction equation for cross sections that would qualify for the more liberal interaction equations of Section H1.

The interaction equation, Equation H2-1, applies equally to the case where the axial force is in tension. Equation H2-1 was written in stress format as an aid in examining the condition at the various critical locations of the unsymmetric member. For unsymmetrical sections with uniaxial or biaxial flexure, the critical condition is dependent on the resultant direction of the moment. This is also true for singly symmetric members, such as for x-axis flexure of tees. The same elastic section properties are used to compute the corresponding required and available flexural stress terms, which means that the moment ratio will be the same as the stress ratio.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_16/doc_29.md -->

There are two approaches for using Equation H2-1:

(a) Strictly using Equation H2-1 for the interaction of the critical moment about each principal axis, there is only one flexural stress ratio term for every critical location because moment and stress ratios are the same as noted previously. In this case, one would algebraically add the value of each of the ratio terms to obtain the critical condition at one of the extreme fibers.

Using Equation H2-1 is the conservative approach and is recommended for examining members such as single angles. The available flexural stresses at a particular location (tip of short or long leg or at the heel) are based on the yielding limit moment, the local buckling limit moment, or the lateral-torsional buckling moment, consistent with the sign of the required flexural stress. In each case, the yield moment should be based on the smallest section modulus about the axis being considered. One would check the stress condition at the tip of the long and short legs and at the heel and find that at one of the locations the stress ratios would be critical.

(b) For certain load components, where the critical stress can transition from tension at one point on the cross section to compression at another, it may be advantageous to consider two interaction relationships depending on the magnitude of each component. This is permitted by the sentence at the end of Section H2 that permits a more detailed analysis in lieu of Equation H2-1 for the interaction of flexure and tension.

As an example, for a tee with flexure about both the x- and y-axes creating tension at the tip of the stem, compression at the flange could control or tension at the stem could control the design. If y-axis flexure is large relative to x-axis flexure, the stress ratio need only be checked for compression at the flange using corresponding design compressive stress limits. However, if the y-axis flexure is small relative to the x-axis flexure, then one would check the tensile stress condition at the tip of the stem, this limit being independent of the amount of the y-axis flexure. The two differing interaction expressions are

 $$ \left|\frac{f_{ra}}{F_{ca}}+\frac{f_{rby}}{F_{cby}}+\frac{f_{rbx}}{F_{cbx}}\right|\leq1.0at tee flange $$ 

and

 $$ \left|\frac{f_{ra}}{F_{ca}}+\frac{f_{rbx}}{F_{cbx}}\right|\leq1.0at tee stem $$ 

The interaction diagrams for biaxial flexure of a WT using both approaches are illustrated in Figure C-H2.1.

Another situation in which one could benefit from consideration of more than one interaction relationship occurs when axial tension is combined with a flexural compression limit based on local buckling or lateral-torsional buckling. An example of this is when the stem of a tee in flexural compression is combined with axial tension. The introduction of the axial tension will reduce the compression that is imposed the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_0.md -->

buckling stress limit. With a required large axial tension and a relatively small flexural compression, the design flexural stress could be set at the yield limit at the stem. The interaction equation is then,

 $$ \left|\frac{f_{ra}}{F_{ca}}+\frac{f_{rbx}}{F_{cbx}}\right|\leq1.0 $$ 

where  $ F_{cbx} $  is the flange tension stress based on reaching  $ \upphi F_{y} $  in the stem. There could be justification for using  $ F_{cbx} $  equal to  $ \upphi F_{y} $  in this expression.

This interaction relationship would hold until the interaction between the flexural compressive stress at the stem with  $ F_{cbx} $  based on the local or lateral-torsional buckling limit, as increased by the axial tension, would control, resulting in the following interaction:

 $$ \left|\frac{f_{ra}}{F_{ca}}-\frac{f_{rbx}}{F_{cbx}}\right|\leq1.0 $$ 

The interaction diagrams for this case, using both approaches, are illustrated in Figure C-H2.2.

### H3. MEMBERS SUBJECTED TO TORSION AND COMBINED TORSION, FLEXURE, SHEAR, AND/OR AXIAL FORCE

Section H3 provides provisions for cases not covered in the previous two sections. The first two parts of this section address the design of HSS members, and the third part is a general provision directed to cases where the designer encounters torsion in addition to normal stresses and shear stresses.

### 1. Round and Rectangular HSS Subjected to Torsion

Hollow structural sections (HSS) are frequently used in space-frame construction and in other situations wherein significant torsional moments must be resisted by the members. Because of its closed cross section, an HSS is far more efficient in resisting torsion than an open cross section, such as an I-shape or a channel. While normal and shear stresses due to restrained warping are usually significant in shapes of open cross section, they are insignificant in closed cross sections. The total torsional moment can be assumed to be resisted by pure torsional shear stresses. These are often referred to in the literature as St. Venant torsional stresses.

The pure torsional shear stress in HSS is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the wall of the cross section, and it is equal to the torsional moment divided by a torsional shear constant for the cross section, C. In a limit state format, the nominal torsional resisting moment is the torsional shear constant times the critical shear stress,  $ F_{cr} $ .

For round HSS, the torsional shear constant is equal to the polar moment of inertia divided by the radius:

 $$ C=\frac{\pi\left(D^{4}-D_{i}^{4}\right)}{32D/2}\approx\frac{\pi t\left(D-t\right)^{2}}{2} $$ 

where  $ D_{i} $  is the inside diameter.

For rectangular HSS, the torsional shear constant is obtained as  $ 2tA_{o} $  using the membrane analogy (Timoshenko, 1956), where  $ A_{o} $  is the area bounded by the midline of the section. Conservatively assuming an outside corner radius of 2t, the midline radius is 1.5t and

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_17_img_in_image_box_201_760_661_1154.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-H2.2. WT with flexural compression on the stem plus axial tension.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_2.md -->

 $$ A_{o}=\big(B-t\big)\big(H-t\big)-9t^{2}\frac{\big(4-\pi\big)}{4} $$ 

resulting in

 $$ C=2t\big(B-t\big)\big(H-t\big)-4.5t^{3}\big(4-\pi\big) $$ 

The resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , and the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ , are the same as for flexural shear in Chapter G.

When considering local buckling in round HSS subjected to torsion, most structural members will either be long or of moderate length and the provisions for short cylinders will not apply. The elastic local buckling strength of long cylinders is unaffected by end conditions and the critical stress is given in Ziemian (2010) as

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{K_{t}E}{\left(\frac{D}{t}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}} $$ 

The theoretical value of  $ K_{t} $  is 0.73 but a value of 0.6 is recommended to account for initial imperfections. An equation for the elastic local buckling stress for round HSS of moderate length where the edges are not fixed at the ends against rotation is given in Schilling (1965) and Ziemian (2010) as

 $$ F_{cr}=\frac{1.23E}{\left(\frac{D}{t}\right)^{\frac{5}{4}}\sqrt{\frac{L}{D}}} $$ 

This equation includes a 15% reduction to account for initial imperfections. The length effect is included in this equation for simple end conditions, and the approximately 10% increase in buckling strength is neglected for edges fixed at the end. A limitation is provided so that the shear yield strength,  $ 0.6F_{y} $ , is not exceeded.

The critical stress provisions for rectangular HSS are identical to the flexural shear provisions of Section G4 with the shear buckling coefficient equal to  $ k_{\nu}=5.0 $ . The shear distribution due to torsion is uniform in the longest sides of a rectangular HSS, and this is the same distribution that is assumed to exist in the web of an I-shaped beam. Therefore, it is reasonable that the provisions for buckling are the same in both cases.

### 2. HSS Subjected to Combined Torsion, Shear, Flexure, and Axial Force

Several interaction equation forms have been proposed in the literature for load combinations that produce both normal and shear stresses. In one common form, the normal and shear stresses are combined elliptically with the sum of the squares (Felton and Dobbs, 1967):

 $$ \left(\frac{f}{F_{cr}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{f_{v}}{F_{vcr}}\right)^{2}\leq1 $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_3.md -->

In a second form, the first power of the ratio of the normal stresses is used:

 $$ \left(\frac{f}{F_{cr}}\right)+\left(\frac{f_{v}}{F_{vcr}}\right)^{2}\leq1 $$ 

The latter form is somewhat more conservative, but not overly so (Schilling, 1965), and this is the form used in this Specification:

 $$ \left(\frac{P_{r}}{P_{c}}+\frac{M_{rx}}{M_{cx}}+\frac{M_{ry}}{M_{cy}}\right)+\left(\frac{V_{r}}{V_{c}}+\frac{T_{r}}{T_{c}}\right)^{2}\leq1.0 $$ 

where the terms with the subscript r represent the required strengths, and the ones with the subscript c are the corresponding available strengths. For this edition of the Specification, provisions have been explicitly given for biaxial bending and shear. Normal effects due to flexural and axial load effects are combined linearly and then combined with the square of the linear combination of flexural and torsional shear effects. When an axial compressive load effect is present, the required flexural strength,  $ M_{r} $ , is to be determined by second-order analysis. When normal effects due to flexural and axial load effects are not present, the square of the linear combination of flexural and torsional shear effects underestimates the actual interaction. A more accurate measure is obtained without squaring this combination.

### 3. Non-HSS Members Subjected to Torsion and Combined Stress

This section covers all the cases not previously covered. Examples are built-up un-symmetric crane girders and many other types of odd-shaped built-up cross sections. The required stresses are determined by elastic stress analysis based on established theories of structural mechanics. The three limit states to consider and the corresponding available stresses are as follows:

(a) Yielding under normal stress— $ F_{y} $ 

(b) Yielding under shear stress—0.6Fy

(c) Buckling— $ F_{cr} $ 

In most cases, it is sufficient to consider normal stresses and shear stresses separately because maximum values rarely occur in the same place in the cross section or at the same place in the span. AISC Design Guide 9, Torsional Analysis of Structural Steel Members (Seaburg and Carter, 1997), provides a complete discussion on torsional analysis of open shapes.

Particularly in open sections under warping stresses due to torsion the region of the cross section that is subjected to yielding may be quite small, and adjacent to regions that remain elastic. Prior to 2022, the Specification specifically permitted constrained local yielding adjacent to areas that remain elastic. However, the provisions provided no quantitative method and were deemed unenforceable. Engineers addressing non-HSS members subjected to torsion and combined stress must exercise judgment. Overstress as high as 15% has been allowed for warping stresses under combined stresses in AISI S100 (AISI, 2016).

### H4. RUPTURE OF FLANGES WITH BOLT HOLES AND SUBJECTED TO TENSION

Equation H4-1 is provided to evaluate the limit state of tensile rupture of the flanges of beam-columns. This provision is only applicable in cases where there are one or more bolt holes in the flange in net tension under the combined effect of flexure and axial forces. When both the axial and flexural stresses are tensile, their effects are additive. When the stresses are of opposite sign, the tensile effect is reduced by the compression effect.

# CHAPTER I DESIGN OF COMPOSITE MEMBERS

Chapter I includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) This chapter now includes reinforcing requirements for filled and encased composite members, which had previously been included by reference from ACI 318.

(2) Provisions for filled composite plate shear walls consisting of two steel plates connected by tie bars have been added.

(3) By reference to Appendix 2, composite members constructed from materials with strengths above the limits given here have been added.

### I 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Design of composite members requires consideration of structural steel, reinforcing steel, and concrete behavior. These provisions were developed with the intent both to minimize conflicts between current steel and reinforced concrete design and detailing provisions and to give proper recognition to the advantages of composite design.

The provisions in Chapter I address strength design of composite members only. The designer needs to consider the loads resisted by the steel section alone when determining load effects during the construction phase. The designer also needs to consider deformations throughout the life of the structure and the appropriate cross section for those deformations. When considering these latter limit states, due allowance should be made for the additional long-term changes in stresses and deformations due to creep and shrinkage of the concrete.

Reference is made to ACI 318 and ACI 318M (ACI, 2019), subsequently referred to as ACI 318, for provisions related to the concrete and reinforcing steel portion of composite design and detailing, such as anchorage and splice lengths, intermediate column ties, beam stirrups, reinforcing spirals, and shear and torsion provisions.

Structural steel and reinforced concrete are sometimes combined in practice for application in columns and beams where the resulting member does not strictly qualify as a composite member according to the provisions. For example, structural steel beams or columns designed to carry all the load can be encased in concrete where the concrete and reinforcing steel are not considered for strength; filled composite columns can be designed as reinforced concrete columns where the structural steel perimeter is used as a form only without necessarily meeting the width-to-thickness limits in Table I1.1. In the former case, the concrete and reinforcing steel requirements should be detailed according to ACI 318; and, in the latter case, the concrete and reinforcing steel should be designed and detailed according to ACI 318.

### 1. Concrete and Steel Reinforcement

Exceptions, limitations, and additional information are provided as follows:

(a) ACI 318 no longer addresses requirements for composite columns although provisions for composite piles are still addressed in Chapter 18 of ACI 318. The Specification provisions take advantage of research into composite behavior (Hajjar, 2000; Shanmugam and Lakshmi, 2001; Leon et al., 2007; Ziemian, 2010; Jacobs and Goverdhan, 2010; Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015; Lai et al., 2016; Denavit et al., 2016a; Lai and Varma, 2015).

(b) Concrete limitations in addition to those given in ACI 318 are provided to reflect the applicable range of test data on composite members.

(c) For encased composite columns, ACI 318 provisions for sizing and detailing transverse steel reinforcement for conventional reinforced concrete compression members should be followed in addition to the provisions specified in Section I2.1a(b).

(d) For filled composite columns with internal reinforcement (internal reinforcement is not necessarily required), ACI 318 provisions for longitudinal and transverse reinforcing steel should be followed unless more specific requirements are specified in the Specification.

(e) For encased beams and filled beams where internal reinforcement is provided (internal reinforcement is not necessarily required for filled beams), ACI 318 provisions for longitudinal and transverse reinforcing steel should be followed unless more specific requirements are specified in the Specification.

The value of  $ 0.01A_{g} $  in ACI 318 is the minimum ratio of longitudinal reinforcement in reinforced concrete compression members. The intent of this provision is to reduce the effects of creep and shrinkage of the concrete under sustained compressive loading. It is also intended for resisting incidental bending not captured in the analysis. The inclusion of an encased structural steel section meeting the requirements of Section I2.1a aids in mitigating these effects and consequently allows a reduction in the minimum longitudinal reinforcement ratio required. See also Commentary Section I2.1a(c).

### 2. Nominal Strength of Composite Sections

The cross-section strength of composite members is computed based on one of the four methods presented in this section of the Specification. This forms the basis for calculating the nominal axial and flexural strength for composite members which are then used to determine member strength under interaction. The first method is the plastic stress distribution method, which provides a general method for calculating the cross-sectional strength for composite members with compact composite cross sections. The second method is the strain compatibility method, which provides an alternative method for calculating the cross-section strength for composite members with compact composite cross sections. The third approach is the elastic stress distribution method, which has been retained from previous editions of the Specification where it was used for the calculation of the strength of composite beams with

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_7.md -->

noncompact webs. The fourth method is the effective stress-strain method, which provides guidance for calculating the cross-section strength for composite members with noncompact composite or slender-element composite cross sections. The plastic stress distribution method provides a simple and convenient calculation method for the most common design situations and is preferred. Further discussion related to the effects of member slenderness and second-order forces on interaction equations is provided in Commentary Section I5.

### 2 a. Plastic Stress Distribution Method

The plastic stress distribution method is based on the plastic limit analysis of the cross section, which is assumed to undergo complete plastification and form a mechanism (plastic hinge). Steel and concrete materials are assumed to have rigid-plastic uniaxial behavior with the steel yield stress equal to  $ F_{y} $  in either tension or compression and the concrete compressive stress uniformly distributed and equal to  $ 0.85f_{c}^{\prime} $  unless a round hollow structural section (HSS) is used (see the following discussion). The tensile strength of the concrete is ignored. Force equilibrium is established over the cross section to calculate points for the axial force-plastic moment section strength for the composite cross section to generate a P-M interaction diagram such as those shown in Figure C-I1.1. As a simplification, four or five points can be used to establish this diagram (Roik and Bergmann, 1992; Ziemian, 2010; Geschwindner, 2010b; Moon et al., 2013; Denavit et al., 2016b). These points are identified as A, B, C, D, and E in Figure C-I1.1.

The plastic stress distribution method assumes (a) that sufficient strains have developed in the steel and concrete for both to reach their yield strength and (b) that local buckling is delayed until yielding of the steel and concrete crushing have taken place, based on the use of a compact composite section. Tests and analyses have shown that these are reasonable assumptions for both concrete-encased steel sections with steel anchors and for HSS that comply with these provisions (Hajjar, 2000; Shanmugam

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_17_img_in_image_box_121_850_417_1108.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_17_img_in_image_box_442_849_739_1112.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-I1.1. Comparison between exact and simplified moment-axial compressive force cross-section strength envelopes.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_8.md -->

and Lakshmi, 2001; Varma et al., 2002; Leon et al., 2007; Ziemian, 2010). For round HSS, these provisions allow for the increase of the usable concrete stress to  $ 0.95f_{c}^{\prime} $  for calculating both axial compressive and flexural strengths to account for the beneficial effects of the confinement arising from the hoop action (Leon et al., 2007).

Based on similar assumptions, but allowing for slip between the steel beam and the composite slab, simplified expressions can also be derived for typical composite beam sections. Strictly speaking, these distributions are not based on slip, but on the strength of the shear connection. Full interaction is assumed if the shear connection strength exceeds that of either (a) the tensile yield strength of the steel section or the compressive strength of the concrete slab when the composite beam is loaded in positive moment, or (b) the tensile yield strength of the longitudinal reinforcing bars in the slab or the compressive strength of the steel section when loaded in negative moment.

When steel anchors are provided in sufficient numbers to fully develop this flexural strength, any slip that occurs prior to yielding has a negligible effect on behavior. When full interaction is not present, the beam is said to be partially composite. The effects of slip on the elastic properties of a partially composite beam can be significant and should be accounted for in calculations of deflections and stresses at service loads. Approximate elastic properties of partially composite beams are given in Commentary Section I3.

### 2 b. Strain Compatibility Method

The principles used to calculate cross-sectional strength in Section I1.2a may not be applicable to all design situations or possible cross sections. As an alternative, Section I1.2b permits the use of a generalized strain-compatibility approach that allows the use of any reasonable uniaxial stress-strain model for the steel and concrete. This method is focused on ultimate strength and does not contemplate the use of pseudo-material properties to explicitly account for three-dimensional phenomena like local buckling and confinement that may arise in noncompact composite and slender-element composite sections. Refer to the effective stress-strain method for considering these phenomena.

### 2 c. Elastic Stress Distribution Method

The use of an elastic stress distribution is recognized as being particularly relevant for the design of composite beams, encased composite members, and filled composite members for which the plastic stress distribution method is not applicable. Additional discussion for this method can be found in Commentary Sections I3.2a and I3.3.

### 2 d. Effective Stress-Strain Method

This methodology provides one alternative for calculating the cross-section strength for composite members, including noncompact composite and slender-element composite cross sections. The effective stress-strain method is applicable when using a fiber-based approach for calculating the cross section axial force-moment strength interaction, while assuming strain compatibility and utilizing modified material

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_9.md -->

stress-strain curves to account implicitly for the effects of steel HSS local buckling, yielding, residual stresses, concrete cracking, concrete crushing, confinement, and any other effects that significantly impact the strength of the cross section (Sakino et al., 2004; Han et al., 2005; Liang, 2009; Lai and Varma, 2016).

### 3. Material Limitations

The provisions of Chapter I were developed using experimental data in the bulk of literature, generally satisfying the range of material limitations given in Section I.3 (Ziemian, 2010; Hajjar, 2000; Shanmugam and Lakshmi, 2001; Varma et al., 2002; Leon et al., 2007). A limit of 10 ksi (69 MPa) is imposed on the concrete specified compressive strength for strength calculations unless the provisions of Appendix 2 are used, both to reflect the limited experimental data available above this strength and the changes in behavior observed (Varma et al., 2002). The specified minimum yield stress of the reinforcing bars is limited to a maximum value of 80 ksi (550 MPa). A lower limit of 3 ksi (21 MPa) is specified for both normal and lightweight concrete and an upper limit of 6 ksi (41 MPa) is specified for lightweight concrete to encourage the use of good quality, yet readily available, grades of structural concrete. The use of higher strengths in computing the modulus of elasticity and thus the stiffness of composite members for serviceability is permitted. However, the use of higher strengths in computing the strength of composite members is not permitted without appropriate testing and analyses. Alternatively, the provisions of Appendix 2 may be used for the design of rectangular filled composite members constructed from materials with higher strengths than those specified by the limits in Section I.3.

### 4. Classification of Filled Composite Sections for Local Buckling

The behavior of filled composite members is fundamentally different from the behavior of hollow steel members. The concrete infill has a significant contribution to the stiffness, strength, and ductility of composite members. As the steel section area decreases, the concrete contribution becomes more significant.

For structural steel members, the terms “compact section” and “noncompact section” apply only to flexure and are related to the ability of the section to maintain a rotation capacity of approximately three before the onset of local buckling. For structural steel members, the terms “slender section” and “nonslender section” apply only to compression and are related to the ability of the section to reach column buckling strength before local buckling.

For filled composite members, the terms “compact composite section” and “noncompact composite section” apply to both flexure and compression and are not related to the rotation capacity. A compact composite section has sufficient element width-to-thickness ratio to develop yielding in longitudinal compression and provide confinement to the concrete infill to develop its compressive strength  $ (0.85f_{c}^{\prime} $  or  $ 0.95f_{c}^{\prime}) $ . A noncompact composite section has sufficient element width-to-thickness ratio to develop yielding in longitudinal compression, but not to confine the concrete infill. After exceeding a concrete compressive stress of  $ 0.70f_{c}^{\prime} $ , the volumetric dilation of the concrete increases, but the stiffness of steel elements (already yielded in longitudinal compression) is likely inadequate to confine the concrete infill, and the noncompact composite section undergoes volumetric dilation and local buckling.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_10.md -->

A slender-element composite section has an element width-to-thickness ratio such that it can neither develop yielding of the steel in the longitudinal direction nor confine the concrete after it reaches  $ 0.70 f_{c}^{\prime} $  compressive stress (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015).

The elastic local buckling of the steel HSS is influenced significantly by the presence of the concrete infill. The concrete infill changes the buckling mode of the steel HSS (both within the cross section and along the length of the member) by preventing it from deforming inwards as shown in Figures C-I1.2 and C-I1.3. Bradford et al. (1998) analyzed the elastic local buckling behavior of filled composite compression members, showing that for rectangular steel HSS, the plate buckling coefficient, k, in the elastic plate buckling equation (Ziemian, 2010) changes from 4.00 for hollow tubes to 10.6 for filled sections. As a result, the elastic plate buckling stress increases by a factor of 2.65 for filled sections as compared to HSS. Similarly, Bradford et al. (2002) showed that the elastic local buckling stress for filled round sections is 1.73 times that for hollow round sections.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_11.md -->

For rectangular filled sections, the elastic local buckling stress,  $ F_{n} $ , from the plate buckling equation simplifies to Equation I2-10. This equation indicates that yielding will occur for plates with b/t less than or equal to  $ 3.00\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , which designates the limit between noncompact composite and slender-element composite sections,  $ \lambda_{r} $ . This limit does not account for the effects of residual stresses or geometric imperfections because the concrete contribution governs for these larger b/t ratios and the effects of reducing steel stresses is small. The maximum permitted b/t value is based on the lack of experimental data above the limit of  $ 5.00\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , and the potential effects (plate deflections and locked-in stresses) of concrete placement in extremely slender-element composite filled HSS cross sections. For flexure, the b/t limits for the flanges are the same as those for walls in axial compression due to the similarities in loading and behavior. The compact/noncompact composite limit,  $ \lambda_{p} $ , for webs in flexure was established conservatively as  $ 3.00\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ . The noncompact/slender-element composite limit,  $ \lambda_{r} $ , for the web was established conservatively as  $ 5.70\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , which is also the maximum permitted for unfilled HSS. This limit was also established as the maximum permitted value due to the lack of experimental data and concrete placement concerns for thinner filled HSS cross sections (Lai et al., 2014).

For filled round HSS in axial compression, the noncompact/slender-element composite limit,  $ \lambda_{r} $ , was established as  $ 0.19E/F_{y} $ , which is 1.73 times the limit of  $ 0.11E/F_{y} $  for unfilled round HSS. This was based on the findings of Bradford et al. (2002) and it compares well with experimental data. The maximum permitted D/t equal to  $ 0.31E/F_{y} $  is based on the lack of experimental data and the potential effects of concrete placement in extremely slender-element composite filled HSS cross sections. For filled round HSS in flexure, the compact/noncompact composite limit,  $ \lambda_{p} $ , in Table I1.1b was developed conservatively as 1.25 times the limit  $ 0.07E/F_{y} $  for unfilled round HSS. The noncompact/slender-element composite limit,  $ \lambda_{r} $ , was assumed conservatively to be the same as for unfilled round HSS,  $ 0.31E/F_{y} $ . This limit was also established as the maximum permitted value due to lack of experimental data and concrete placement concerns for thinner filled HSS cross sections (Lai and Varma, 2015).

### 5. Stiffness for Calculation of Required Strengths

This section along with Chapter C forms the basis of the direct analysis method of design for structural systems including encased composite members or filled composite members or composite plate shear walls. The method is identical to the method for structural steel sections alone with the exception of the adjustments to stiffness prescribed for the analysis to determine required strengths.

Stiffness Reduction Parameter,  $ \tau_{b} $ . The reduced stiffness,  $ EI^{*}=0.8\tau_{b}(EI)_{eff} $ , where  $ (EI)_{eff} $  is as calculated in Section I2, and  $ EA^{*}=0.8(E_{s}A_{s}+E_{s}A_{sr}+E_{c}A_{c}) $ , mirrors that used for bare steel. For frames with slender composite members, where the limit state is governed by elastic stability, the factor of  $ 0.8\tau_{b}=0.64 $  on the effective flexural stiffness results in a system available strength equal to 0.64 times the elastic stability limit. This approximates the margin of safety implied in the design provisions for slender composite columns by the effective length procedure, where from Equation I2-3,  $ \phi P_{n}=0.75(0.877P_{e})=0.66P_{e} $ . Second, for frames with intermediate or stocky

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_12.md -->

columns, the  $ 0.8\tau_{b} $  factor reduces the stiffness to account for inelastic softening (for example, concrete cracking and steel partial yielding) prior to the members reaching their design strength.

Unlike for bare steel, the  $ \tau_{b} $  factor is a constant value and does not vary with required axial compressive strength. As a consequence, the use of  $ \tau_{b}=1.0 $  by applying additional notional load, such as described in Section C2.3(c), is inaccurate and not permitted. For the case of a structure containing both composite members and highly loaded  $ (\alpha P_{r}>0.5P_{ns}) $  bare steel members, a conservative approach to avoid a variable stiffness in the analysis would be to apply the additional notional load so that  $ \tau_{b}=1.0 $  can be used for the bare steel members and maintain  $ \tau_{b}=0.8 $  for the composite members.

Research indicates that the stiffness prescribed in this section may result in unconservative errors for very stability sensitive structures (Denavit et al., 2016a). The Specification has traditionally not accounted for long-term effects due to creep and shrinkage; as such, the stiffness prescribed in this section was developed based on studies examining only short-term behavior. Refer to Commentary Sections I1 and I3.2 for additional discussion.

The use of reduced stiffness only pertains to analyses for strength and stability limit states. It does not apply to analyses for other stiffness-based conditions and criteria, such as for drift, deflection, vibration, and period determination. The effective stiffness,  $ (EI)_{eff} $ , has been found to provide a reasonable value for use in determining drifts (Denavit et al., 2018).

This section does not apply to the effective length method. It is recommended that when using the effective length method with composite compression members that either (a) the nominal stiffness be taken as the effective stiffness,  $ EI = (EI)_{eff} $ , and the interaction strength of Section H1.1 be used, or (b) the nominal stiffness be taken as 0.8 times the effective stiffness,  $ EI = 0.8(EI)_{eff} $ , and the interaction strength be determined using one of the methods described in Commentary Section I5.

Composite Plate Shear Wall Effective Stiffness. The stiffness of composite plate shear walls must account for the extent of concrete cracking corresponding to the calculated required strengths. These stiffnesses can be estimated conservatively using equations developed in Agarwal et al. (2020) for uncoupled composite plate shear walls. The effective stiffness of composite plate shear walls can be approximated reasonably using Equation I1-1. This stiffness,  $ (EI)_{eff} $ , is representative of the secant stiffness corresponding to 60% of the flexural capacity,  $ M_{n} $ , of walls subjected to axial compression of about 10% of the concrete capacity,  $ A_{g}f_{c}^{\prime} $ . Equation I1-2 for axial stiffness was calibrated to match the concrete cracking associated with the flexural stiffness of Equation I1-1. Equation I1-3 corresponds to the use of uncracked shear stiffness of composite plate shear walls. Composite walls with overall height-to-length ratio greater than or equal to 3.0 will be flexure dominant, and the shear stiffness can be approximated using uncracked values. When drift limits and stiffness requirements govern design, composite walls may be overdesigned with respect to the required strengths. Overdesigned walls may endure less concrete cracking and their stiffness may be underestimated using Equations I1-1 to I1-3. In such cases, it

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_13.md -->

may be appropriate to use rational analysis methods to estimate the flexural stiffness of the walls, while accounting for the extent of concrete cracking corresponding to the calculated required strength.

### 6. Requirements for Composite Plate Shear Walls

Composite plate shear walls consist of steel modules that are filled with concrete. The steel modules consist of steel plates connected with tie bars and with steel headed stud anchors on the interior surfaces to develop composite action between the steel plates and the concrete infill. The wall ends are closed using flange (closure) plates or boundary elements as shown in Figure C-I1.4. Steel headed stud anchors

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_17_img_in_image_box_277_369_586_430.jpg" ></div>

may be used to replace some rows or columns of tie bars. Coupled wall systems may consist of two or more walls connected by coupling beams. The coupling beams may be filled composite members or steel members.

The two steel plates of composite plate shear walls must be connected using tie bars. These tie bars govern the structural behavior and stability of the empty steel modules before concrete placement. Additional steel headed stud anchors may be used along with tie bars to reduce the slenderness and improve the stability of steel plates after concrete placement.

Composite plate shear walls are referred to as steel plate composite (SC) walls in the design of safety-related nuclear structures according to the AISC Specification for Safety-Related Steel Structures for Nuclear Facilities (AISC, 2018b) and the corresponding AISC Design Guide 32, Design of Modular Steel-Plate Composite Walls for Safety-Related Nuclear Facilities (Bhardwaj and Varma, 2017). The requirements in this Specification are similar, but independent of the requirements for SC walls in nuclear facilities. In building structures, composite plate shear walls are used primarily as slender (overall height-to-length ratio greater than or equal to 3) shear walls or core wall structures. In nuclear structures, the entire structural system consists of several interconnected short squat walls, typically with overall height-to-length ratio less than or equal to 2.

The steel plate reinforcement ratio limits are based on the range available from experiments. Walls without flange (closure) plates or boundary elements have been tested by Kurt et al. (2016). While the behavior may be acceptable, their construction can be difficult due to the absence of closure plates and need for additional formwork.

Seismic provisions for the design of uncoupled and coupled composite plate shear walls—concrete filled are included in the AISC Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2022c), NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures (FEMA, 2020), and ASCE/SEI 7, Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE, 2022). These seismic design provisions build upon the requirements for composite plate shear walls in this Specification.

AISC Design Guide 38, SpeedCore Systems for Steel Structures (Varma et al., 2022) includes detailed guidance along with examples for the design of composite plate shear wall—concrete filled (C-PSW/CF) systems, whether coupled or uncoupled, for wind, seismic, and fire loading conditions.

### 6 a. Slenderness Requirement

The steel plates of composite plate shear walls are required to be nonslender, in other words, yielding in compression must occur before local buckling. When subjected to compressive stresses, the plate undergoes local buckling between the steel tie bars or steel anchors. The lines joining the steel tie bars or anchors act as fold lines, and local buckling occurs between them. The buckling mode indicates fixed ends along the vertical lines with steel anchors, and partial fixity along the vertical lines between steel anchors. Experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_15.md -->

plate slenderness ratio, b/t, defined as the largest clear distance between rows of steel anchors or tie bars, b, divided by the plate thickness, t, on local buckling of plates (Zhang et al., 2014, 2020), leading to Equation I1-4 for the slenderness limit for nonseismic conditions. Because tie bars may also act as anchors, the equation considers the largest unsupported length between rows of steel anchors or tie bars, b. When slenderness exceeds the limit of Equation I1-4, local buckling will occur when the compressive stress reaches  $ F_{n} $ , which can be calculated using Equation C-I1-1, and the compressive strength of the composite wall section can be estimated using Equation C-I1-2 (Zhang et al., 2020).

 $$ F_{n}=\frac{\pi^{2}E}{12\times0.8^{2}\left(\frac{b}{t_{p}}\right)}\leq F_{y} $$ 

 $$ P_{no}=A_{s}F_{n}+0.7A_{c}f_{c}^{\prime} $$ 

### 6 b. Tie Bar Requirement

The tie bar spacing requirement is based on the flexibility and shear buckling of empty steel modules before concrete placement (Varma et al., 2019). The flexibility of the empty modules for transportation, shipping, and handling activities is dominated by their effective shear stiffness,  $ (GA)_{eff} $ , which can be estimated using models (Varma et al., 2019) or calculated conservatively for a unit cell of the module using Equation C-I1-3:

 $$ \left(GA\right)_{eff}=24\Bigg(\frac{EI_{p}}{s_{t}^{2}}\Bigg)\frac{1}{\Big(2\alpha_{p}+1\Big)} $$ 

In this equation,  $ I_{p} $  represents the moment of inertia of the steel faceplates. The variable  $ s_{t} $  represents the tie bar spacing. The variable  $ \alpha_{p} $  is the ratio of the flexural stiffness of the steel plate to the flexural stiffness of the tie bar and simplifies to the form of Equation I1-6.

After assembly and before concrete casting, the empty modules provide structural support for construction activities, loads, and the steel framework connected to it. The buckling of the empty module subjected to compression loading is also governed by its effective shear stiffness,  $ (GA)_{eff} $ , and can be estimated conservatively using Equation C-I1-4:

 $$ \sigma_{cr}=\left[\frac{E}{\left(\frac{s_{t}}{t}\right)^{2}}\right]\frac{1}{\left(2\alpha_{p}+1\right)} $$ 

At the limit, the requirements of Equation I1-5 and I1-6 will result in a critical buckling stress equal to 1 ksi (6.9 MPa), which is equivalent to a distributed loading of 12 kip/ft (175 000 N/m) for walls with two  $ \frac{1}{2} $ -in.- (13-mm-) thick steel plates. The stresses and deflections induced by concrete casting hydrostatic pressure can also be estimated as shown in Varma et al. (2019). Bhardwaj et al. (2018) indicate that modules that meet the plate slenderness requirement of Section I1.6b can be typically cast with concrete pour heights of up to 30 ft (9.1 m) without significant influence of induced deflections and stresses on the compressive strength and buckling of the steel plates.

### I 2. AXIAL FORCE

The design of encased and filled composite members is treated separately, although they have much in common. The intent is to facilitate design by keeping the general principles and detailing requirements for each type of compression member separate.

An ultimate strength cross-section model is used to determine the section strength (Leon et al., 2007; Leon and Hajjar, 2008). This model is similar to that used in previous LRFD Specifications. The design equations in Section I2 for computing compressive axial strength including length effects apply only to doubly symmetric sections. For singly symmetric and unsymmetric sections, only the strain compatibility approach utilizing reasonable limitations on strains (for example, 0.003 for concrete and 0.02 for steel) is applicable for determining cross-sectional strength. As for steel-only columns, more advanced methods are necessary to design singly symmetric and unsymmetric columns to include length effects. Generalized approaches, such as those in Chapters E and F for steel-only columns, are not yet available for composite columns as the variety of sections possible does not lend itself to simplifications.

The design for length effects is consistent with that for steel compression members. The equations used are the same as those in Chapter E modified for use in composite design. As the percentage of concrete in the section decreases, the design defaults to that of a steel section, although with different resistance and safety factors. Comparisons between the provisions in the Specification and experimental data show that the method is generally accurate; however, the coefficient of variation resulting from the application of the strength prediction model is significant given the relatively large statistical scatter associated with the experimental data (Leon et al., 2007; Denavit et al., 2016a).

### 1. Encased Composite Members

### 1 a. Limitations

(1) Encased composite compression members must have a minimum area of steel core such that the steel core area divided by the gross area of the member is equal to or greater than 1%.

(2) The requirements for transverse reinforcement are intended to provide good confinement to the concrete. According to Section I1.1(b), longitudinal and transverse reinforcement requirements in Sections I2 and I3 are to be followed, in addition to those specified in ACI 318. Additional detailing requirements for longitudinal bar spacing and concrete cover have been added that refer to ACI 318.

(3) A minimum longitudinal reinforcement ratio is prescribed so that unreinforced concrete encasements are not designed. Continuous longitudinal bars should be placed at each corner of the cross section. Additional longitudinal reinforcement may be needed for construction of a reinforcing bar cage, but that longitudinal steel does not contribute to the longitudinal reinforcement ratio nor the cross-sectional strength unless it is continuous and properly anchored. A maximum longitudinal reinforcement ratio is also specified.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_17.md -->

(4) The maximum reinforcement ratios prescribed in ACI 318 are to be met. When evaluating this requirement, the gross area of the concrete section,  $ A_{g} $ , as defined in ACI 318 should be taken as the gross area of the composite member.

### 1 b. Compressive Strength

The compressive strength of the cross section,  $ P_{no} $ , is given as the sum of the ultimate strengths of the components. The nominal strength,  $ P_{n} $ , is not capped as in reinforced concrete compression member design for a combination of the following reasons: (a) the resistance factor is 0.75; (b) the required transverse steel provides better performance than a typical reinforced concrete compression member; (c) the presence of a steel section near the center of the section reduces the possibility of a sudden failure due to buckling of the longitudinal reinforcing steel; and (d) there will typically be moment present due to the manner in which stability is addressed in the Specification.

### 1 c. Tensile Strength

This section clarifies the available tensile strength to be used in situations where uplift is a concern and for computations related to beam-column interaction. The provision focuses on the limit state of yielding of the gross area. Where appropriate for the structural configuration, consideration should also be given to other tensile strength and connection strength limit states as specified in Chapters D and J.

### 2. Filled Composite Members

### 2 a. Limitations

(1) As discussed for encased compression members, it is permissible to design filled composite compression members with a steel ratio as low as 1%.

(2) Filled composite sections are classified as compact composite, noncompact composite, or slender-element composite depending on the hollow structural section (HSS) slenderness, b/t or D/t, and the limits in Table I1.1a.

(3) Minimum requirements for detailing reinforcement, if provided, are based on ACI 318 provisions. Note that internal reinforcement is not necessarily required for filled composite columns. Concrete cover requirements between the inside steel perimeter and the longitudinal bars have also been added in Section I2.2e. Refer to Section I4 for shear requirements of filled composite columns.

Walls of rectangular filled sections may be susceptible to deformations during casting if a large hydrostatic pressure is exerted. These deformations will affect the location and initiation of local buckling. To control these deformations, the following serviceability limits are suggested by Leon et al. (2011):

 $$ \sigma_{max}=\max\left[\frac{\left(\frac{2h_{c}}{b_{c}+4h_{c}}\right)\frac{ph_{c}^{2}}{t^{2}}}{\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3b_{c}+4h_{c}}{b_{c}+4h_{c}}\right)\frac{ph_{c}^{2}}{t^{2}}}\right]\leq0.5F_{y} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_18.md -->

 $$ \delta_{max}=\frac{1}{32}\Bigg(\frac{5b_{c}+4h_{c}}{b_{c}+4h_{c}}\Bigg)\frac{ph_{c}^{4}}{E_{s}t^{3}}\leq\frac{L}{2,000} $$ 

where  $ b_{c} $  and  $ h_{c} $  are, respectively, the shorter and the longer inner widths of the rectangular cross section ( $ h_{c} = h - 2t; b_{c} = b - 2t $ ); t is the thickness of wall; b and h are, respectively, the shorter and longer overall outside widths of the rectangular cross section;  $ E_{s} $  is the modulus of elasticity of steel; L is the unbraced member length of the steel encasement; and p is the hydrostatic pressure. If either the corresponding stresses or deformations in rectangular filled composite cross sections exceed the limits given in Equations C-I2-1 or C-I2-2, it is recommended that external supports be added during casting.

(4) Requirements have been added for an upper limit to longitudinal bars in an encased composite column based on limits in ACI 318 for concrete columns.

### 2 b. Compressive Strength

Figure C-I2.1 shows the variation of the nominal axial compressive strength,  $ P_{no} $ , of the composite section with respect to the HSS wall slenderness. As shown, compact composite sections can develop the full plastic strength,  $ P_{p} $ , in compression. The nominal axial strength,  $ P_{no} $ , of noncompact composite sections can be determined using a quadratic interpolation between the plastic strength,  $ P_{p} $ , and the yield strength,  $ P_{y} $ , with respect to the HSS slenderness. This interpolation is quadratic because the ability of the HSS to confine the concrete infill undergoing inelasticity and volumetric dilation decreases rapidly with HSS wall slenderness. Slender-element composite sections are limited to developing the critical buckling stress,  $ F_{n} $ , of the steel HSS and  $ 0.70 f_{c}' $  of the concrete infill (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_19.md -->

The nominal axial strength,  $ P_{n} $ , of composite compression members, including length effects, may be determined using Equations I2-2 and I2-3, while using  $ (EI)_{eff} $  from Equation I2-12 to account for composite section rigidity and  $ P_{no} $  to account for the effects of local buckling as described in the preceding. This approach is different than the one used for HSS found in Section E7. The approach in Section E7 was not implemented for filled compression members because (a) their axial strength is governed significantly by the contribution of the concrete infill, (b) concrete inelasticity occurs within the compression member failure segment irrespective of the buckling load, and (c) the calculated nominal strengths compare conservatively with experimental results (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015).

### 2 c. Tensile Strength

As for encased compression members, this section specifies the tensile strength for filled composite members. Similarly, while the provision focuses on the limit state of yielding of the gross area, where appropriate, consideration should also be given to other tensile strength and connection strength limit states as specified in Chapters D and J.

### 3. Composite Plate Shear Walls

### 3 a. Compressive Strength

For out-of-plane buckling of composite walls,  $ L_{c} $  will typically be equal to the story height. For in-plane buckling of composite walls, stability will typically not govern. Design Guide 38 (Varma et al., 2022) provides additional guidance.

### I 3. FLEXURE

### 1. General

Three types of composite flexural members are addressed in this section: fully encased steel beams, filled HSS, and steel beams with mechanical anchorage to a concrete slab which are generally referred to as composite beams.

### 1 a. Effective Width

The same effective width rules apply to composite beams with a slab on either one side or both sides of the beam. In cases where the effective stiffness of a beam with a one-sided slab is important, special care should be exercised because this model can substantially overestimate stiffness (Brosnan and Uang, 1995). To simplify design, the effective width is based on the full span, center-to-center of supports, for both simple and continuous beams.

### 1 b. Strength During Construction

Composite beam design requires care in considering the loading history. Loads applied to an unshored beam before the concrete has cured are resisted by the steel section alone; total loads applied before and after the concrete has cured are considered to be resisted by the composite section. It is usually assumed for design purposes that concrete has hardened when it attains 75% of its design strength. Unshored beam deflection caused by fresh concrete tends to increase slab thickness.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_20.md -->

and dead load. For longer spans this may lead to instability analogous to roof ponding. Excessive increase of slab thickness may be avoided by beam camber. Placing the slab to a constant thickness will also help eliminate the possibility of ponding instability (Ruddy, 1986). When forms are not attached to the top flange, lateral bracing of the steel beam during construction may not be continuous and the unbraced length may control flexural strength, as defined in Chapter F.

This Specification does not include special requirements for strength during construction. For these noncomposite beams, the provisions of Chapter F apply.

Load combinations for construction loads should be determined for individual projects considering the project-specific circumstances, using ASCE/SEI 37, Design Loads on Structures During Construction (ASCE, 2014) as a guide.

### 2. Composite Beams with Steel Headed Stud or Steel Channel Anchors

This section applies to simple and continuous composite beams with steel anchors, constructed with or without temporary shores.

When a composite beam is controlled by deflection, the design should limit the behavior of the beam to the elastic range under serviceability load combinations. Alternatively, the amplification effects of inelastic behavior should be considered when deflection is checked.

Accurate prediction of flexural stiffness for composite beam members is difficult to achieve, and an examination of previous studies (Leon, 1990; Leon and Alsamsam, 1993) indicates a wide variation between predicted and experimental deflections. More recent studies indicate that the use of the equivalent moment of inertia,  $ I_{equiv} $ , for deflection calculations results in a prediction of short-term deflections roughly equivalent to the statistical average of the experimental tests reviewed (Zhao and Leon, 2013). Previous editions of the Specification recommended an additional reduction factor of 0.75 be applied to  $ I_{equiv} $  to form an effective moment of inertia; however, this approach has been removed as its basis could not be substantiated. An alternative approach is the lower-bound moment of inertia,  $ I_{LB} $ , which is, as the name implies, a lower-bound approach that provides a conservative estimate of short-term deflections; values obtained by the  $ I_{LB} $  approach correspond roughly to the mean plus one standard deviation (84%) based on the 120 tests examined (Zhao and Leon, 2013).

The lower-bound moment of inertia,  $ I_{LB} $ , is defined as

 $$ I_{L B}=I_{s}+A_{s}\left(Y_{E N A}-d_{3}\right)^{2}+\left(\Sigma Q_{n}/F_{y}\right)(2d_{3}+d_{1}-Y_{E N A})^{2} $$ 

where

 $ A_{s} $  = area of steel cross section, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

 $ d_{1} $  = distance from the compression force in the concrete to the top of the steel section, in. (mm)

 $ d_{3} $  = distance from the resultant steel tension force for full section tension yield to the top of the steel, in. (mm)

 $$ I_{L B}=\mathrm{l o w e r-b o u n d~m o m e n t~o f~i n e r t i a,~i n.}^{4}(\mathrm{m m}^{4}) $$ 

 $$ I_{s}=moment of inertia for the structural steel section,in.^{4}(mm^{4}) $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_21.md -->

 $ \Sigma Q_{n} $  = sum of the nominal strengths of steel anchors between the point of maximum positive moment and the point of zero moment, kips (kN)

 $$ Y_{E N A}=\left[A_{s}d_{3}+\left(\Sigma Q_{n}/F_{y}\right)(2d_{3}+d_{1})\right]\Big/\left[A_{s}+\left(\Sigma Q_{n}/F_{y}\right)\right] $$ 

The equivalent moment of inertia,  $ I_{equiv} $ , is defined as

 $$ I_{e q u i v}=I_{s}+\sqrt{\left(\Sigma Q_{n}\left/C_{f}\right.\right)}\left(I_{t r}-I_{s}\right) $$ 

where

 $ C_{f}= $  compression force in concrete slab for fully composite beam; smaller of  $ F_{y}A_{s} $  and  $ 0.85f_{c}^{\prime}A_{c} $ , kips (N)

 $ A_{c}= $  area of concrete slab within the effective width, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

 $ I_{tr} = \frac{moment of inertia for the fully composite uncracked transformed section, in.}{mm^{4}} $ 

The effective section modulus,  $ S_{eff} $ , referred to the tension flange of the steel section for a partially composite beam, may be approximated by

 $$ S_{e f f}=S_{s}+\sqrt{\left(\Sigma Q_{n}/C_{f}\right)}\left(S_{t r}-S_{s}\right) $$ 

where

$S_{s} = \text{section modulus for the structural steel section, referred to the tension flange, in}^{3} (\text{mm}^{3})$

$S_{tr}$ = section modulus for the fully composite uncracked transformed section, referred to the tension flange of the steel section, in.$^{3}$ (mm$^{3}$)

The value of  $ \Sigma Q_{n}/C_{f} $  may not be taken as greater than 1.0 in Equations C-I3-3 and C-I3-4. The upper bound of 1.0 represents a member that is fully composite.

Additionally, Equations C-I3-3 and C-I3-4 should not be used for ratios,  $ \Sigma Q_{n}/C_{f} $ , less than 0.25. This restriction is to prevent excessive slip and the resulting substantial loss in beam stiffness. Studies indicate that Equations C-I3-3 and C-I3-4 adequately reflect the reduction in beam stiffness and strength, respectively, when fewer anchors are used than required for full composite action (Grant et al., 1977).

The use of a constant stiffness in elastic analyses of continuous beams is analogous to the practice in reinforced concrete design. The stiffness calculated using a weighted average of moments of inertia in the positive moment region and negative moment regions may take the following form:

 $$ I_{t}=a I_{p o s}+b I_{n e g} $$ 

where

 $ I_{pos} $  = effective moment of inertia for positive moment, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

 $ I_{neg} $  = effective moment of inertia for negative moment, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

For continuous beams subjected to gravity loads only, the value of a may be taken as 0.6 and the value of b may be taken as 0.4. For composite beams used as part of a lateral force-resisting system in moment frames, the value of a and b may be taken as 0.5 for calculations related to drift.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_22.md -->

Practice in the United States does not generally require the following items to be considered. These items are highlighted here for designers evaluating atypical conditions for which they might apply.

(a) Horizontal shear strength of the slab: For the case of girders with decks with narrow troughs or thin slabs, shear strength of the slab may govern the design (for example, see Figure C-I3.1). Although the configuration of decks built in the United States tends to preclude this mode of failure, it is important that it be checked if the force in the slab is large or an unconventional assembly is chosen. The shear strength of the slab may be calculated as the superposition of the shear strength of the concrete plus the contribution of any slab steel crossing the shear plane. The required shear strength, as shown in the figure, is given by the difference in the force between the regions inside and outside the potential failure surface. Where experience has shown that longitudinal cracking detrimental to serviceability is likely to occur, the slab should be reinforced in the direction transverse to the supporting steel section. It is recommended that the area of such reinforcement be at least 0.002 times the concrete area in the longitudinal direction of the beam and that it be uniformly distributed.

(b) Rotational capacity of hinging zones: There is no required rotational capacity for hinging zones. Where plastic redistribution to collapse is allowed, the moments at a cross section may be as much as 30% lower than those given by a corresponding elastic analysis. This reduction in load effects is predicated, however, on the ability of the system to deform through very large rotations. To achieve these rotations, very strict local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling requirements must be fulfilled (Dekker et al., 1995). For cases in which a 10% redistribution is utilized, as permitted in Appendix 8, Section 8.2, the required rotation capacity is within the limits provided by the local and lateral-torsional buckling provisions of Chapter F. Therefore, a rotational capacity check is not normally required for designs using this provision.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_23.md -->

(c) Long-term deformations due to shrinkage and creep: There is no direct guidance on the computation of the long-term deformations of composite beams due to creep and shrinkage. The long-term deformation due to shrinkage can be calculated with the simplified model shown in Figure C-I3.2, in which the effect of shrinkage is taken as an equivalent set of end moments given by the shrinkage force (long-term restrained shrinkage strain times modulus of concrete times effective area of concrete) times the eccentricity between the center of the slab and the elastic neutral axis. If the restrained shrinkage coefficient for the aggregates is not known, the shrinkage strain,  $ e_{sh} $ , for these calculations may be taken as 0.02%. The long-term deformations due to creep, which can be quantified using a model similar to that shown in the figure, are small unless the spans are long and the permanent live loads large. For shrinkage and creep effects, special attention should be given to lightweight aggregates, which tend to have higher creep coefficients and moisture absorption and lower modulus of elasticity than conventional aggregates, exacerbating any potential deflection problems. Engineering judgment is required, as calculations for long-term deformations require consideration of the many variables involved and because linear superposition of these effects is not strictly correct (ACI, 1997; Viest et al., 1997).

### 2 a. Positive Flexural Strength

The flexural strength of a composite beam in the positive moment region may be controlled by the strength of the steel section, the concrete slab, or the steel headed stud anchors. In addition, web buckling may limit flexural strength if the web is slender and a sufficient portion of the web is in compression.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_17_img_in_image_box_194_718_668_1122.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_24.md -->

Plastic Stress Distribution for Positive Moment. When flexural strength is determined from the plastic stress distribution shown in Figure C-I3.3, the compression force in the concrete slab, C, is the smallest of the following:

 $$ C=F_{y}A_{s} $$ 

 $$ C=0.85f_{c}^{\prime}A_{c} $$ 

 $$ C=\Sigma Q_{n} $$ 

where

 $ A_{c} $  = area of concrete slab within effective width, in. $ ^{2} $ (mm $ ^{2} $ )

 $$ A_{s} = area of steel cross section, in.^{2} (mm^{2}) $$ 

 $$ F_{y}=specified minimum yield stress of steel,ksi(MPa) $$ 

 $ \Sigma Q_{n}= $  sum of nominal strengths of steel headed stud anchors between the point of maximum positive moment and the point of zero moment to either side, kips (N)

 $$ f_{c}^{\prime} = specified compressive strength of concrete, ksi (MPa) $$ 

Longitudinal slab reinforcement makes a negligible contribution to the compression force, except when Equation C-I3-7 governs. In this case, the area of longitudinal reinforcement within the effective width of the concrete slab times the yield stress of the reinforcement may be added in determining C.

The depth of the compression block is

 $$ a=\frac{C}{0.85f_{c}^{\prime}b} $$ 

where

b = effective width of concrete slab, in. (mm)

A fully composite beam corresponds to the case where C is governed by either Equation C-I3-6 or C-I3-7. If C is governed by Equation C-I3-8, the beam is partially composite. The plastic stress distribution may have the plastic neutral axis (PNA) in the web, in the top flange of the steel section, or in the slab, depending on the governing C.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_17_img_in_image_box_176_919_688_1162.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-I3.3. Plastic stress distribution for positive moment in composite beams.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_25.md -->

Using Figure C-I3.3, the nominal plastic moment strength of a composite beam in positive bending is given by

 $$ M_{n}=C(d_{1}+d_{2})+P_{y}(d_{3}-d_{2}) $$ 

where

 $ P_{y} $  = tensile strength of the steel section, kips (N)

 $$ =F_{y}A_{s} $$ 

 $ d_{1} $  = distance from the centroid of the compression force in the concrete slab to the top of the steel section, in. (mm)

 $ d_{2}= $  distance from the centroid of the compression force in the steel section to the top of the steel section, in. (mm). For the case of no compression in the steel section,  $ d_{2}=0 $ .

 $ d_{3}= $  distance from  $ P_{y} $  to the top of the steel section, in. (mm)

Equation C-I3-10 is applicable for steel sections symmetrical about one or two axes.

According to Table B4.1b, Case 15, local web buckling does not reduce the plastic strength of a bare steel beam if the width-to-thickness ratio of the web is not larger than  $ 3.76\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ . In the absence of web buckling research on composite beams, the same ratio is conservatively applied to composite beams. All current ASTM A6/A6M W-shapes have compact webs for  $ F_{y} \leq 70 $  ksi (485 MPa).

Elastic Stress Distribution. For beams with more slender webs, this Specification conservatively adopts first yield as the flexural strength limit using the elastic stress distribution method. In this case, stresses on the steel section from permanent loads applied to unshored beams before the concrete has cured must be superimposed on stresses on the composite section from loads applied to the beams after hardening of concrete. For shored beams, all loads may be assumed to be resisted by the composite section.

When first yield is the flexural strength limit, the elastic transformed section is used to calculate stresses on the composite section. The modular ratio,  $ n = E_{s} / E_{c} $ , used to determine the transformed section, depends on the specified unit weight and strength of concrete.

### 2 b. Negative Flexural Strength

Plastic Stress Distribution for Negative Moment. When an adequately braced compact steel section and adequately developed longitudinal reinforcing bars act compositely in the negative moment region, the nominal flexural strength is determined from the plastic stress distribution, as shown in Figure C-I3.4. Loads applied to a continuous composite beam with steel anchors throughout its length, after the slab is cracked in the negative moment region, are resisted in that region by the steel section and by properly anchored longitudinal slab reinforcement.

The tensile force, T, in the reinforcing bars is the smaller of

 $$ T=F_{yr}A_{r} $$ 

 $$ T=\Sigma Q_{n} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_26.md -->

where

$A_{r}$ = area of properly developed slab reinforcement parallel to the steel beam and within the effective width of the slab, in.$^{2}$ (mm$^{2}$)

 $ F_{yr} $  = specified minimum yield stress of the slab reinforcement, ksi (MPa)

 $ \Sigma Q_{n}= $  sum of the nominal strengths of steel headed stud anchors between the point of maximum negative moment and the point of zero moment to either side, kips (N)

A third theoretical limit on T is the product of the area and yield stress of the steel section; however, this limit is redundant in view of practical limitations for slab reinforcement.

Using Figure C-I3.4, the nominal plastic moment strength of a composite beam in negative bending is given by

 $$ M_{n}=T(d_{1}+d_{2})+P_{yc}(d_{3}-d_{2}) $$ 

where

 $$ P_{yc}=compressive strength of the steel section,kips(N) $$ 

 $$ =F_{y}A_{s} $$ 

 $ d_{1} $  = distance from the centroid of the longitudinal slab reinforcement to the top of the steel section, in. (mm)

 $ d_{2} $  = distance from the centroid of the tension force in the steel section to the top of the steel section, in. (mm)

 $ d_{3} $  = distance from  $ P_{yc} $  to the top of the steel section, in. (mm)

When utilizing composite action in negative moment regions, designers need to recognize two interrelated factors (Figure C-13.5). First, the plastic neutral axis will move up due to the presence of slab longitudinal reinforcement, resulting in an increase in longitudinal compressive strain in the bottom flange of the steel beam when compared to the case of flexure in the steel beam alone. This shift makes local buckling of the web and bottom flange more likely than if the girder were considered as a bare steel member and may also impact the global buckling of the member. Because local web buckling is likely the most critical mode, the User Note for this section advocates the use of Case 15 for the web and Case 10 for the flange in Table B4.1b.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_17_img_in_image_box_181_943_679_1171.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-I3.4. Plastic stress distribution for negative moment.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_17/doc_27.md -->

Second, due to the presence of a slab, the global buckled shape as a function of the unbraced length of the member corresponds to a distortional buckling mode (Bradford and Trahair, 1981) rather than to a lateral-torsional buckling mode. As a result, the equations related to unbraced length given in Chapter F to determine the design strength of the steel beam, are not strictly applicable. However, analytical solutions for elastic distortional buckling indicate that, for most practical cases (for example,  $ L/h_{o} > 10 $  and  $ h_{o}/t_{w} < 50 $ , where L = length of span,  $ h_{o} = distance between flange centroids $ , and  $ t_{w} = thickness of web $ ), the beam will be able to attain its plastic moment well before any global buckling occurs (Bradford and Gao, 1992). A simple and conservative solution for determining the limiting unbraced lengths of a composite beam in negative flexure is to replace the longitudinal reinforcement with an equivalent cover plate at the top flange and compute  $ L_{p} $  in accordance with Section F4. This approach is conservative, as it neglects the rotational stiffness provided by the slab.

### 2 c. Composite Beams with Formed Steel Deck

Figure C-I3.6 is a graphic presentation of the terminology used in Section I3.2c.

The design rules for composite construction with formed steel deck are based upon a study (Grant et al., 1977) of the then-available test results. The limiting parameters listed in Section I3.2c were established to keep composite construction with formed steel deck within the available research data.

The Specification requires steel headed stud anchors to project a minimum of  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm) above the deck flutes. This is intended to be the minimum in-place projection, and stud lengths prior to installation should account for any shortening of the stud that could occur during the welding process. The minimum specified cover over a steel headed stud anchor of  $ \frac{1}{2} $  in. (13 mm) after installation is intended to prevent the anchor from being exposed after construction is complete. In achieving this requirement, the designer should carefully consider tolerances on steel beam camber, concrete placement, and finishing tolerances, and the accuracy with which steel beam deflections can be calculated. In order to minimize the possibility of exposed anchors in the final construction, the designer should consider increasing the bare steel beam size to reduce or eliminate camber requirements (this also improves

floor vibration performance), checking beam camber tolerances in the fabrication shop, and monitoring concrete placement operations in the field. Wherever possible, the designer should also consider providing for anchor cover requirements above the  $ \frac{1}{2} $  in. (13 mm) minimum by increasing the slab thickness while maintaining the  $ \frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm) requirement for anchor projection above the top of the steel deck as required by the Specification.

The maximum spacing of 18 in. (450 mm) for connecting composite decking to the support is intended to address a minimum uplift requirement during the construction phase prior to placing concrete (SDI, 2001).

### 2 d. Load Transfer Between Steel Beam and Concrete Slab

### 1. Load Transfer for Positive Flexural Strength

Shear connection at the interface of a concrete slab and supporting steel members is an assembly consisting of the connector, typically a steel headed stud anchor, its weld to the steel member, and the surrounding concrete with a specific deck flute geometry. The shear connection deforms when subjected to shear at the interface. Its ability to deform without fracturing is known as slip capacity or ductility of the shear connection. It is important to note that the term ductility does not merely relate to the ductility of the connector itself, but to the ductility of the overall shear connection assembly. While the slip capacity of the shear connection consisting of a  $ \frac{3}{4} $ -in.-(19-mm-) diameter steel headed stud anchor embedded in a solid slab is about  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) (Oehlers and Coughlan, 1986), the shear connection with the same connector embedded in a slender concrete slab rib will possess only a fraction of this slip capacity (Lyons et al., 1994; Roddenberry et al., 2002a). Similarly, these same sources show that shear connection ductility can be significantly larger for some configurations.

Flexural strength of a composite section based on a plastic stress distribution is the most typical manner for establishing the member strength. It assumes sufficiently ductile steel and concrete components capable of developing a fully plastic stress block across the depth of the composite section. This analysis also assumes a sufficiently ductile shear connection, allowing for the shear at the interface to be evenly shared among the connectors located between the points of zero and maximum moment. Reliability studies evaluating the computational models for the flexural strength of composite beams (Galambos and Ravindra, 1978; Roddenberry et al., 2002a; Mujagic and Easterling, 2009) are based on the plastic stress distribution methodology. An implicit assumption of the theory is that the shear demands at the interface can be uniformly distributed over the shear span because the connectors are ductile and can redistribute the demands (Viest et al., 1997). Even when shear connections possess adequate ductility to accommodate interfacial slip, excessive slip demand at the interface may cause excessive discontinuities in the strain diagram at the interface of the concrete slab and cause early departure from the elastic behavior, and as a consequence, invalidate the design approach if inadequate connectivity is provided. It is therefore important to limit the shear connection slip demand at the interface.

The determination of flexural strength based on the plastic stress distribution method without any specific slip capacity checks was reasonable until the mid-1980s, given that low levels of partial composite action were uncommon in design and that most spans were relatively short. Today, the design for composite beams often involves much longer spans that are governed by serviceability criteria and therefore require less composite action to achieve their required strength. The simultaneous use of lower levels of composite action and longer spans results in additional deformation demands on the shear studs. Mujagic et al. (2015) and

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_0.md -->

Selden et al. (2015) indicate that long beams designed at low levels of partial composite action may not reach their nominal strength due to lack of connector deformation capacity.

The consideration of ductility demand at the interface of composite beams can come in the form of a number of different approaches of varying degrees of complexity. These approaches generally fall into two groups. First, the effect of shear at the interface can be taken into account directly in the determination of member strength through modeling of the interface slip. The complexity of such an analysis varies greatly based upon whether all components of the composite beams are idealized as linearly elastic (Newmark et al., 1951; Robinson and Naraine, 1988; Viest et al., 1997), or considered using a nonlinear analysis by capturing inelastic behavior of a partially yielded section and nonlinear behavior of the shear connection along the span (Salari et al., 1998; Salari and Spacone, 2001; Zona and Ranzi, 2014). Second, various indirect analytical models have been proposed. Such models aim to provide convenient computational models suitable for routine design use by either idealizing various components of the composite beam as fully elastic or fully plastic and capturing most dominant elements driving the shear connection ductility demand (Oehlers and Sved, 1995) or by parametrically relating the results of rigorous nonlinear finite element analyses to the most critical design properties affecting shear connection ductility through simple algebraic relationships (Johnson and Molenstra, 1991).

Configurations of composite beams as designed in routine practice depend on strength and serviceability requirements, detailing rules, construction sequence, framing details, fabrication logistics, fire rating requirements, as well as various other considerations related to standard practice. For beams that are loaded uniformly or due to equally spaced concentrated loads, such as a typical girder, the studies (Mujagic et al., 2015; Selden et al., 2015) indicate that beams are not susceptible to connector failure due to insufficient deformation capacity, and thus, need not be checked for this limit state if they meet one or more of the following conditions:

(a) Beams with span not exceeding 30 ft (9.1 m);

(b) Beams with a degree of composite action of at least 50%; or

(c) Beams with an average nominal shear connector capacity of at least 16 kip/ft (230 000 N/m) along their shear span, corresponding to a  $ \frac{3}{4} $ -in.- (19-mm-) diameter steel headed stud anchor placed at 12 in. (300 mm) spacing on average.

Beams that do not meet the foregoing criteria or have an unsymmetrical loading configuration may still be acceptable and can be evaluated through direct nonlinear modeling of the member capturing all sources of deformation. Such modeling should be performed under factored loads using strength and stiffness properties of the member. The analysis should meet the pertinent requirements of Appendix 1. Furthermore, the analytical model should be validated using experimental data with respect to the load-deformation properties of both the member global behavior and the behavior of the shear connection at the interface of the slab and beam. Such validation should utilize strength and stiffness properties that match the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_1.md -->

constitutive models reflected in the actual experimental data. Experimental data providing insight into the load-deformation response of the shear connection and the composite member as a whole is provided by Lyons et al. (1994) and Roddenberry et al. (2002a). As another alternative, the mixed analysis approach provided by Oehlers and Sved (1995) can be used.

When steel headed stud anchors are used on beams with formed steel deck, they may be welded directly through the deck or through prepunched or cut-in-place holes in the deck. The usual procedure is to install steel headed stud anchors by welding directly through the deck. However, special precautions and procedures recommended by the stud manufacturer should be followed when the following conditions exist:

(a) The deck thickness is greater than 16 ga. (1.5 mm) for single thickness or 18 ga. (1.2 mm) for each sheet of double thickness; or

(b) The total thickness of galvanized coating is greater than 1.25 ounces/ft $ ^{2} $  (0.38 kg/m $ ^{2} $ ).

Composite beam tests in which the longitudinal spacing of steel headed stud anchors was varied according to the intensity of the static shear, and duplicate beams in which the anchors were uniformly spaced, exhibited approximately the same ultimate strength and approximately the same amount of deflection at nominal loads. Under distributed load conditions, only a slight deformation in the concrete near the more heavily stressed anchors is needed to redistribute the horizontal shear to other less heavily stressed anchors. The important consideration is that the total number of anchors be sufficient to develop the shear on either side of the point of maximum moment. The provisions of this Specification are based upon this concept of composite action.

### 2. Load Transfer for Negative Flexural Strength

In computing the available flexural strength at points of maximum negative bending, reinforcement parallel to the steel beam within the effective width of the slab may be included, provided such reinforcement is properly anchored beyond the region of negative moment. However, steel anchors are required to transfer the ultimate tensile force in the reinforcement from the slab to the steel beam.

When the steel deck includes units for carrying electrical wiring, crossover headers are commonly installed over the cellular deck perpendicular to the ribs. These create trenches that completely or partially replace sections of the concrete slab above the deck. These trenches, running parallel to or transverse to a composite beam, may reduce the effectiveness of the concrete flange. Without special provisions to replace the concrete displaced by the trench, the trench should be considered as a complete structural discontinuity in the concrete flange.

When trenches are parallel to the composite beam, the effective flange width should be determined from the known position of the trench.

Trenches oriented transverse to composite beams should, if possible, be located in areas of low bending moment and the full required number of studs should be placed between the trench and the point of maximum positive moment. Where the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_2.md -->

trench cannot be located in an area of low moment, the beam should be designed as noncomposite.

### 3. Encased Composite Members

Tests of concrete-encased beams demonstrate that (a) the encasement drastically reduces the possibility of lateral-torsional instability and prevents local buckling of the encased steel, (b) the restrictions imposed on the encasement practically prevent bond failure prior to first yielding of the steel section, and (c) direct bond interaction between the steel and concrete, without the use of additional anchorage, is insufficient to develop the composite action necessary to achieve the full plastic moment capacity of the composite section (Hawkins, 1973; ASCE, 1979; Juang and Hsu, 2006). Accordingly, this Specification permits three alternative design methods for the determination of the nominal flexural strength: (a) based on an elastic stress distribution using first yield in the tension flange of the composite section; (b) based on the plastic flexural strength of the steel section alone; and (c) based on the strength of the composite section obtained from the plastic stress distribution method or the strain-compatibility method. An assessment of the data indicates that the same resistance and safety factors may be used for all three approaches (Leon et al., 2007). For concrete-encased composite beams, method (c) is applicable only when shear anchors are provided along the steel section and reinforcement of the concrete encasement meets the specified detailing requirements. For concrete-encased composite beams, no limitations are placed on the slenderness of either the composite beam or the elements of the steel section, because the encasement effectively inhibits both local and lateral buckling.

In method (a), stresses on the steel section from permanent loads applied to unshored beams before the concrete has hardened must be superimposed on stresses on the composite section from loads applied to the beams after hardening of the concrete. In this superposition, all permanent loads should be multiplied by the dead load factor and all live loads should be multiplied by the live load factor. For shored beams, all loads may be assumed as resisted by the composite section. Complete interaction (no slip) between the concrete and steel is assumed.

Insufficient research is available to allow coverage of partially composite encased sections subjected to flexure.

Guidelines have been added for longitudinal and transverse steel limits and detailing based on past experience with concrete beams as covered in ACI 318 (ACI, 2019). Absent specific test results, the guidelines in ACI 318 are referenced. A requirement that concrete encased composite beams be tension controlled is provided so that a ductile performance occurs in case of an overload. The area of the steel core is intended to be included in checking this requirement.

### 4. Filled Composite Members

Tests of filled composite beams indicate that (a) the steel HSS drastically reduces the possibility of lateral-torsional instability, (b) the concrete infill changes the local buckling mode of the steel HSS, and (c) direct bond interaction between the steel and concrete, without the use of additional anchorage, is sufficient to develop the composite action necessary to achieve the full plastic moment capacity even for cases with unrestrained slip potential (Lu and Kennedy, 1994; Prion and Boehme,

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_3.md -->

1994; Wheeler and Bridge, 2006; Leon et al., 2007; Lehman et al., 2018a; Kenarangi and Bruneau, 2019).

Figure C-I3.7 shows the variation of the nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , of the filled section with respect to the HSS wall slenderness. As shown, compact composite sections can develop the full plastic strength,  $ M_{p} $ , in flexure. The nominal flexural strength,  $ M_{n} $ , of noncompact composite sections can be determined using a linear interpolation between the plastic strength,  $ M_{p} $ , and the elastic strength based on the yield strength,  $ M_{y} $ , with respect to the HSS wall slenderness. Slender-element composite sections are limited to developing the first yield moment,  $ M_{cr} $ , of the composite section where the tension flange reaches first yielding, while the compression flange is limited to the critical buckling stress,  $ F_{n} $ , and the concrete is limited to linear elastic behavior with maximum compressive stress equal to  $ 0.7 f_{c}^{\prime} $  (Lai et al., 2014). The nominal flexural strengths calculated using the Specification compare conservatively with experimental results (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015). Figure C-I3.8 shows typical stress blocks for determining the nominal flexural strengths of compact composite, noncompact composite, and slender-element composite filled rectangular box sections.

Longitudinal and transverse reinforcement is not required for filled composite beams. Absent specific research and tests for internally reinforced filled composite beams, reasonable guidelines have been added for the case where internal longitudinal reinforcing steel is added. If internal reinforcement is provided for additional capacity, a minimum longitudinal reinforcing steel ratio of 0.004 is required as a reasonable lower limit based on past experience with concrete encased columns. Minimum transverse steel is required for holding the internal cage in place for constructability. Note that transverse reinforcement does not add significant shear strength to the member. The guidelines in ACI 318 are referenced for an upper-bound limit on longitudinal reinforcement. A requirement that filled composite beams be tension-controlled is therefore provided so that a ductile performance occurs in case of an overload. The area of the steel perimeter is intended to be included in checking this requirement.

### 5. Composite Plate Shear Walls

The flexural capacity of composite plate shear walls can be calculated using a plastic stress distribution over the wall cross section. This is in accordance with Section I1.2a, where the steel yield stress in compression and tension is equal to  $ F_{y} $  and the concrete compressive stress is equal to  $ 0.85f_{c}^{\prime} $ .

### I 4. SHEAR

### 1. Encased Composite Members

Three methods for determining the shear strength of encased composite members are provided:

(a) The intent is to allow the designer to ignore the concrete contribution entirely and simply use the provisions of Chapter G with their associated resistance or safety factors.

(b) When using only the strength of the reinforcing steel and concrete, a resistance factor of 0.75 or the corresponding safety factor of 2.00 is to be applied, which is consistent with ACI 318.

(c) When using the strength of the steel section in combination with the contribution of the transverse reinforcing bars, the nominal shear strength of the steel section alone should be determined according to the provisions of Chapter G and then combined with the nominal shear strength of the transverse reinforcement as determined by ACI 318. This combined nominal strength should then be multiplied by an overall resistance factor of 0.75 or divided by the safety factor of 2.00 to determine the available shear strength of the member.

Though it would be logical to suggest provisions where both the contributions of the steel section and reinforced concrete are superimposed, there is insufficient research available to justify such a combination.

### 2. Filled Composite Members

The shear strength of circular and rectangular filled composite members in flexure is calculated in accordance with this section. Values of  $ K_{c} $  have been established and calibrated considering experimental results (Kenarangi et al., 2021), and data from cyclic testing (Nakahara and Tsumura, 2014; Bruneau et al., 2018; Kenarangi and Bruneau, 2020a, 2020b) and monotonic loading (Xu et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2012; Lehman et al., 2018a, 2018b; Ye et al., 2016) for composite filled round HSS and filled rectangular sections (Koester, 2000; Fischer and Varma, 2015a).

Equation I4-1 combines the plastic shear strength of the steel HSS and the contribution of the concrete fill, which depends on the shear span-to-depth ratio illustrated in Figure C-I4.1. Research has demonstrated that the concrete fill adds substantially to the shear strength of filled composite members. Specimens with and without internal reinforcement were shown to exhibit similar cyclic shear strengths in experiments by Bruneau et al. (2018). The contribution of the internal reinforcement to the total shear strength was found to be marginal compared to the strength provided by the steel HSS, and is, therefore, not part of the design equations.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_6.md -->

For very short shear spans, the shear behavior is governed by the formation of a strut in the infill concrete. For example, for circular cross sections, the contribution of this diagonal has been reported to be largest for shear span-to-diameter ratio,  $ M_{u}/V_{u}d $ , of 0.25 (Bruneau et al., 2018; Kenarangi and Bruneau, 2020b), progressively decreasing for smaller or greater values of this ratio.

An adequate development length must be present on both sides of a shear region where  $ K_{c} $  greater than 1 is considered. This permits the development of the diagonal strut, which typically flows between compression zones on both sides of the high shear region. Lehman et al. (2018a, 2018b) recommends the use of a minimum development length of 1 times the diameter of a filled round HSS beyond the point of zero moment to the point of maximum moment to achieve the full plastic capacity of the member.

### 3. Composite Beams with Formed Steel Deck

A conservative approach to shear provisions for composite beams with steel headed stud or steel channel anchors is adopted by assigning all shear to the steel section in accordance with Chapter G. This method neglects any concrete contribution and serves to simplify design.

### 4. Composite Plate Shear Walls

The in-plane shear behavior of composite plate shear walls is governed by the plane stress behavior of the plates and the orthotropic elastic behavior of concrete cracked in principal tension. Varma et al. (2014) and Seo et al. (2016) discuss the

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_235_710_605_1080.jpg" ></div>


Shear span-to-depth ratio:  $ \frac{a}{d}=\frac{(M_{u}/V_{u})}{d}=\frac{M_{u}}{V_{u}d} $ 

<div style="text-align: center;">Figure C-I4.1. Shear span-to-depth ratio for filled composite flexural members.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_7.md -->

in-plane shear behavior of composite plate shear walls. The nominal shear force corresponding to the onset of yielding of the steel plates is given by Equation I4-2. The corresponding principal compressive stress in the cracked (orthotropic) concrete is less than  $ 0.7f_{c}^{\prime} $  for typical composite walls with reinforcement ratios,  $ 2t/t_{sc} $ , less than or equal to 10%. For walls with very high reinforcement ratios (in other words, walls with very thick steel plates compared to overall thickness), the concrete principal compressive stress can be the limiting failure criterion (Seo et al., 2016; Varma et al., 2014). The ultimate shear strength of composite walls, beyond the yielding of the steel plates, depends on the compression strut failure of the cracked concrete infill and can be 20 to 30% higher (Booth et al., 2019).

The out-of-plane shear strength of composite plate shear walls rarely governs design. However, if perimeter composite plate shear walls are used on the exterior surfaces of the building, then out-of-plane shear strength may have to be checked for wind pressure. Equations for calculating out-of-plane strength are included in the AISC Specification for Safety-Related Steel Structures for Nuclear Facilities, Section N9.3.5 (AISC, 2018b). The development of these equations is presented in Sener and Varma (2014) and Sener et al. (2015), and their use is demonstrated in AISC Design Guide 32 (Bhardwaj and Varma, 2017).

### I 5. COMBINED FLEXURE AND AXIAL FORCE

Required strengths for composite beam-columns are determined according to the provisions of Chapter C. Section I1.5 provides the appropriate stiffness for composite members to be used with the direct analysis method of Chapter C. For the assessment of available strength, the Specification provisions for interaction between axial force and flexure in composite members are the same as for bare steel members as covered in Section H1.1. The provisions also permit an analysis based on the strength provisions of Section I1.2 that leads to an interaction diagram similar to those used in reinforced concrete design. The latter approach is discussed here.

For encased composite members, the available axial strength, including the effects of buckling, and the available flexural strength can be calculated using either the plastic stress distribution method or the strain-compatibility method (Leon et al., 2007; Leon and Hajjar, 2008). For filled composite members, the available axial and flexural strengths can be calculated using Sections I2.2 and I3.4, respectively, which also include the effects of local buckling for noncompact composite and slender-element composite sections classified according to Section I1.4.

The following commentary describes three different approaches to designing composite beam-columns that are applicable to both concrete-encased steel shapes and compact composite filled HSS, and a fourth approach that is applicable to noncompact composite or slender-element composite filled sections. The first two approaches are based on variations in the plastic stress distribution method while the third method references AISC Design Guide 6, Load and Resistance Factor Design of W-Shapes Encased in Concrete (Griffis, 1992), which is based on an earlier version of the Specification. The strain compatibility method is similar to that used in the design of concrete compression members as specified in ACI 318, Chapter 22 (ACI, 2019).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_8.md -->

Method 1—Interaction Equations of Section H1.1. The first approach applies to doubly symmetric composite beam-columns, the most common geometry found in building construction. For this case, the interaction equations of Section H1.1 provide a conservative assessment of the available strength of the member for combined axial compression and flexure as illustrated in Figure C-I5.1. These provisions may also be used for combined axial tension and flexure. The degree of conservatism generally depends on the extent of concrete contribution to the overall strength relative to the steel contribution. The larger the load-carrying contribution coming from the steel section, the less conservative the strength prediction of the interaction equations from Section H1.1. Thus, for example, the equations are generally more conservative for members with high concrete compressive strength as compared to members with low concrete compressive strength. The advantages of this method include the following: (a) the same interaction equations used for steel beam-columns are applicable; and (b) only two anchor points are needed to define the interaction curves—one for pure flexure (point B) and one for pure axial load (point A). Point A is determined using Equations I2-2 or I2-3, as applicable. Note that slenderness must also be considered using the provisions of Section I2. Point B is determined as the flexural strength of the section according to the provisions of Section I3.

The nominal strengths predicted using the equations of Section H1.1 compare conservatively with a wide range of experimental data for noncompact and slender-element composite rectangular and round filled sections (Lai et al., 2014; Lai and Varma, 2015).

Method 2—Interaction Curves from the Plastic Stress Distribution Method. The second approach applies to doubly symmetric encased and compact filled composite beam-columns and is based on developing interaction surfaces for combined axial compression and flexure at the nominal strength level using the plastic stress distribution method. This approach results in interaction surfaces similar to those shown in Figure C-I5.2. The four points, A through D, identified in Figure C-I5.2,

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_18_img_in_chart_box_248_826_615_1162.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-I5.1. Interaction diagram for composite beam-column design—Method 1.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_9.md -->

are defined by the plastic stress distribution used in their determination. The strength equations for encased W-shapes and filled HSS shapes used to define each point are provided in the AISC Steel Construction Manual Part 6 (AISC, 2017). Point A is the pure axial strength determined according to Section I2. Point B is determined as the flexural strength of the section according to the provisions of Section I3. Point C corresponds to a plastic neutral axis location that results in the same flexural strength as point B, but including axial compression. Point D corresponds to an axial compressive strength of one-half of that determined for point C. An additional point E, as shown in Figure C-I1.1(b), is included (between points A and C) for encased W-shapes bent about their weak axis. Point E is an arbitrary point, generally corresponding to a plastic neutral axis location at the flange tips of the encased W-shape, used to better reflect bending strength for weak-axis bending of encased shapes. Linear interpolation between these anchor points may be used. However, with this approach, care should be taken in reducing point D by a resistance factor or to account for member slenderness, as this may lead to an unsafe situation whereby additional flexural strength is permitted at a lower axial compressive strength than predicted by the cross-section strength of the member. This potential problem may be avoided through a simplification to this method whereby point D is removed from the interaction surface. Figure C-I5.3 demonstrates this simplification with the vertical dashed line that connects point C" to point B". Once the nominal strength interaction surface is determined, length effects according to Equations I2-2 and I2-3 must be applied to obtain points A' through E'. Note that the same slenderness reduction factor  $ (\lambda = A'/A $  in Figure C-I5.2, equal to  $ P_n/P_{no} $ , where  $ P_n $  and  $ P_{no} $  are calculated from Section I2) applies to points A, C, D, and E. The available strength is then determined by applying the compression and flexure resistance factors or safety factors to points A" through E".

 $$ \mathsf{A}^{\prime}=\lambda\mathsf{A} $$ 

 $$ \mathsf{A}^{\prime\prime}=\Phi\mathsf{A}^{\prime} $$

Using linear interpolation between points A", C", and B" in Figure C-I5.3, the following interaction equations may be derived for composite beam-columns subjected to combined axial compression plus biaxial flexure:

Method 3—Design Guide 6. The approach presented in AISC Design Guide 6 (Griffis, 1992) may also be used to determine the beam-column strength of encased W-shapes. Although this method is based on an earlier version of the Specification, available axial and flexural strengths can conservatively be determined directly from the tables in this design guide. The difference in resistance factors from the earlier Specification may safely be ignored.

Method 4—Direct Interaction Method for Noncompact Composite and Slender-Element Composite Filled Sections. For filled noncompact composite and slender-element composite members, the interaction equations in Section H1.1 can be conservative (Lai et al., 2016). The interaction between axial compression, P, and flexure, M, in filled composite members is typically seen to vary with the strength ratio,  $ c_{sr} $ , which is calculated using Equation I5-2 as the yield strength of the steel components divided by the compressive strength of the concrete component. As the  $ c_{sr} $  ratio increases, the steel component dominates. As the ratio decreases, the concrete component dominates.

This behavior is illustrated in Figure C-I5.4, which shows interaction curves developed using Equations I5-1a and b. Lai et al. (2016) developed these equations as a bilinear simplification of the parabolic P-M interaction curves for filled composite members with noncompact composite or slender-element composite cross sections. The three anchor points of the normalized interaction curve include (a) the member available axial compressive strength as a column,  $ P_{c} $ , determined using Section I2.2b; (b) the member available flexural strength,  $ M_{c} $ , determined using Section I3.4;

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_18_img_in_chart_box_153_688_708_1117.jpg" ></div>

and (c) the balance point with coordinates  $ (c_{m}, c_{p}) $ . The balance point coordinates are functions of the strength ratio,  $ c_{sr} $ , and calculated using Table I5.1 for rectangular and round filled composite members.

The interaction curve developed using Equations I5-1a and b is recommended for noncompact or slender-element filled composite members: (a) with governing unsupported length-to-diameter, L/D, or length-to-width, L/B, ratios less than or equal to 20; and (b) not providing stability support to gravity-only columns with significant axial loading. In situations where (a) and (b) are not met, the balance point with coordinates  $ (c_{m}, c_{p}) $  may be reduced further due to slenderness effects. This potential problem can be addressed through the simplified method described earlier and shown in Figure C-I5.3, where the increased available flexural strength due to axial compression is removed from the interaction curve.

The flexural capacity of composite plate shear walls subjected to axial compression can be estimated using the plastic stress distribution method of Section I1.2a, or the effective stress-strain method of Section I1.2d (Bruneau et al., 2019; Shafaei et al., 2021a, b). Bruneau et al. (2019) and Shafaei et al. (2021a) have reported the results of experimental investigations on planar walls subjected to different axial load and cyclic lateral loading up to failure.

### I 6. LOAD TRANSFER

### 1. General Requirements

External forces are typically applied to composite members through direct connection to the steel member, bearing on the concrete, or a combination thereof. Design of the connection for force application follows the requirements for the applicable limit states within Chapters J and K of the Specification as well as the provisions of Section I6. Note that for concrete bearing checks on filled composite members, confinement can affect the bearing strength for external force application as discussed in Commentary Section I6.2.

Once a load path has been provided for the introduction of external forces to the member, the interface between the concrete and steel must be designed to transfer the longitudinal shear required to obtain force equilibrium within the composite section. Section I6.2 contains provisions for determining the magnitude of longitudinal shear to be transferred between the steel and concrete depending upon the external force application condition. Section I6.3 contains provisions addressing mechanisms for the transfer of longitudinal shear.

The load transfer provisions of this section are primarily intended for the transfer of longitudinal shear due to applied axial forces. Load transfer of longitudinal shear due to applied bending moments in encased and filled composite members is beyond the scope of this section; however, tests (Lu and Kennedy, 1994; Prion and Boehme, 1994; Wheeler and Bridge, 2006) indicate that filled composite members can develop their full plastic moment capacity based on bond alone without the use of additional anchorage.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_13.md -->

Composite column base connections are another aspect of load transfer that is not addressed directly by the Specification. As with all frame systems, selecting and proportioning base connections is a critical aspect of the design process. Load paths are required to transfer the internal forces from each component of a composite column (in other words, structural steel, concrete, and reinforcing steel) to the supporting element(s). Several connection types have been proposed in the literature ranging from standard base plate connections (similar to those common for structural steel columns) to embedded connections of various configurations. Not all the proposed connections are capable of developing the full strength of the composite column. Hitaka et al. (2003) and Stephens et al. (2016) describe the practical limitations of several types of these connections.

### 2. Force Allocation

This Specification addresses conditions in which the entire external force is applied to the steel or concrete as well as conditions in which the external force is applied to both materials concurrently. The provisions are based upon the assumption that in order to achieve equilibrium across the cross section, transfer of longitudinal shears along the interface between the concrete and steel shall occur such that the resulting force levels within the two materials may be proportioned according to the relative cross-sectional strength contributions of each material. Load allocation based on the cross-sectional strength contribution model is represented by Equations I6-1 and I6-2. Equation I6-1 represents the magnitude of force that is present within the concrete encasement or concrete fill at equilibrium. The longitudinal shear generated by loads applied directly to the steel section is determined based on the amount of force to be distributed to the concrete according to Equation I6-1. Conversely, when load is applied to the concrete section only, the longitudinal shear required for cross-sectional equilibrium is based upon the amount of force to be distributed to the steel according to Equation I6-2. Where loads are applied concurrently to the two materials, the longitudinal shear force to be transferred to achieve cross-sectional equilibrium can be taken as either the difference in magnitudes between the portion of external force applied directly to the concrete and that required by Equation I6-1 or the portion of external force applied directly to the steel section and that required by Equations I6-2a and b. For filled composite members, the steel contribution to the overall nominal axial compressive strength of the cross section decreases with increasing slenderness ratio  $ (b/t $  or  $ D/t) $ . As a result, it is not permitted to apply axial force directly to the steel wall of filled composite sections classified as slender-element composite because the stress concentrations associated with force application could cause premature local buckling. Additionally, the magnitude of longitudinal shears required to be transferred to the concrete infill would require impractical load transfer lengths.

When external forces are applied to the concrete of a filled composite member via bearing, it is acceptable to assume that adequate confinement is provided by the steel encasement to allow the maximum available bearing strength permitted by Equation J8-2 to be used. This strength is obtained by setting the term  $ \sqrt{A_{2}/A_{1}} $  equal to 2. This discussion is in reference to the introduction of external load to the compression member. The transfer of longitudinal shear within the compression member via bearing mechanisms, such as internal steel plates, is addressed in Section I6.3a.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_14.md -->

The Specification provisions assume that the required external force to be allocated imparts compression to the composite section. For applied tensile force, it is generally acceptable to design the component of the composite member to which the force is applied (in other words, either the steel section or the longitudinal reinforcement) to resist the entire tensile force, and no further force transfer calculations are necessary. For atypical conditions where the magnitude of required external tensile force necessitates the use of longitudinal reinforcement in conjunction with the steel section, force allocation to each component may be determined as follows.

When the entire external tensile force is applied directly to the steel section,

 $$ V_{r}^{\prime}=P_{r}\Big(1-F_{y}A_{s}/P_{n}\Big) $$ 

When the entire external tensile force is applied directly to the longitudinal reinforcement,

 $$ V_{r}^{\prime}=P_{r}\left(F_{y}A_{s}/P_{n}\right) $$ 

where

 $ P_{n} $  = nominal axial tensile strength, determined by Equation I2-8 for encased composite members, and Equation I2-14 for filled composite members, kips (N)

 $ P_{r}= $  required external tensile force applied to the composite member, kips (N)

 $ V_{r}^{\prime}= $  required longitudinal shear force to be transferred to the steel section or longitudinal reinforcement, kips (N)

Where longitudinal reinforcing bars are used to resist tension forces, they must use appropriate lap splices in accordance with ACI 318 (ACI, 2019) as directed by Section I1. For sustained tension, mechanical splices are required by ACI 318, Section 25.5.7.4.

### 3. Force Transfer Mechanisms

Transfer of longitudinal shear by direct bearing via internal bearing mechanisms, such as internal bearing plates or shear connection via steel anchors, is permitted for both filled and encased composite members. Transfer of longitudinal shear via direct bond interaction is permitted solely for compact and noncompact filled composite members. Although it is recognized that force transfer also occurs by direct bond interaction between the steel and concrete for encased composite columns, this mechanism is typically ignored and shear transfer is generally carried out solely with steel anchors (Griffis, 1992).

The use of the force transfer mechanism providing the largest resistance is permissible. Superposition of force transfer mechanisms is not permitted as the experimental data indicate that direct bearing or shear connection often does not initiate until after direct bond interaction has been breached, and little experimental data is available regarding the interaction of direct bearing and shear connection via steel anchors.

The restriction, added in this edition of the Specification, that direct bond interaction shall not be used for filled composite members where bond failure could result in uncontrolled slip, is intended to prevent reliance on this mechanism in cases, such as tension hangers, where static equilibrium cannot be achieved after limited slip.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_15.md -->

### 3 a. Direct Bearing

For the general condition of load applied directly to concrete in bearing, and considering a supporting concrete area that is wider on all sides than the loaded area, the nominal bearing strength for concrete is given by Equation J8-2:

 $$ R_{n}=0.85f_{c}^{\prime}A_{1}\sqrt{A_{1}/A_{2}}\leq1.7f_{c}^{\prime}A_{1} $$ 

where

 $ A_{1}= $  loaded area of concrete, in. $ ^{2} $  (mm $ ^{2} $ )

$A_{2} = \text{maximum area of the portion of the supporting surface that is geometrically similar to and concentric with the loaded area, in.}^{2} (\text{mm}^{2})$

 $ f_{c}^{\prime} $  = specified compressive concrete strength, ksi (MPa)

The value of  $ \sqrt{A_{2}/A_{1}} $  must be less than or equal to 2 (ACI, 2019).

For the specific condition of transferring longitudinal shear by direct bearing via internal bearing mechanisms, Equation I6-3 uses the maximum nominal bearing strength allowed by Equation J8-2 of  $ 1.7f_{c}^{\prime}A_{1} $ . The resistance factor for bearing on concrete,  $ \phi_{B} $ , is 0.65 (and the safety factor for bearing on concrete,  $ \Omega_{B} $ , is 2.31) in accordance with Section J8.

### 3 b. Shear Connection

Steel anchors shall be designed according to the provisions for composite components in Section I8.3.

### 3 c. Direct Bond Interaction

Force transfer by direct bond is commonly used in filled composite members as long as the connections are detailed to limit local deformations (API, 1993; Roeder et al., 1999). While chemical adhesion provides some contribution, direct bond is primarily a frictional resistance mechanism. There is large scatter in the experimental data on the bond of filled composite compression members; however, some trends have been identified (Roeder et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2012). Larger cross sections, thinner walls, rectangular shapes, smoothed or oiled interfaces, and high-shrinkage concrete contribute to lower apparent bond strengths. Smaller cross sections, thicker walls, circular shapes, rougher interfaces, expansive concrete, and the presence of bending moment (including eccentric loading such as from shear tabs) contribute to higher apparent bond strengths.

The equations for direct bond interaction for filled composite compression members assume the entire interface perimeter is engaged in the transfer of stress. Accordingly, the strength is compared to the sum of the force required to be transferred from connecting elements framing in from all sides. The scatter in the experimental data leads to the recommended low value of the resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , and the corresponding high value of the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ .

### 4. Detailing Requirements

To avoid overstressing the structural steel section or the concrete at connections in encased or filled composite members, transfer of longitudinal shear is required to occur within the load introduction length. The load introduction length is taken as

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_16.md -->

2 times the minimum transverse dimension of the composite member both above and below the load transfer region. The load transfer region is generally taken as the depth of the connecting element as indicated in Figure C-I6.1. In cases where the applied forces are of such a magnitude that the required longitudinal shear transfer cannot take place within the prescribed load introduction length, the designer should treat the compression member as noncomposite along the additional length required for shear transfer.

For encased composite members, steel anchors are required throughout the compression member length to maintain composite action of the member under incidental moments (including flexure induced by incipient buckling). These anchors are typically placed at the maximum permitted spacing according to Section I8.3e. Additional anchors required for longitudinal shear transfer shall be located within the load introduction length as described previously.

Unlike concrete encased members, steel anchors in filled members are required only when used for longitudinal shear transfer and are not required along the length of the member outside of the introduction region. This difference is due to the adequate confinement provided by the steel encasement which prevents the loss of composite action under incidental moments.

### I 7. COMPOSITE DIAPHRAGMS AND COLLECTOR BEAMS

In composite construction, floor or roof slabs consisting of composite metal deck and concrete fill are typically connected to the structural framing to form composite

diaphragms. Diaphragms are horizontally spanning members, analogous to deep beams, which distribute lateral loads from their origin to the lateral force-resisting system either directly or in combination with load transfer elements known as collectors or collector beams (also known as diaphragm struts and drag struts).

Diaphragms serve the important structural function of interconnecting the components of a structure to help it behave as a unit. Diaphragms are commonly analyzed as simple-span or continuously spanning deep beams, and hence, are subjected to shear, moment, and axial forces, as well as the associated deformations. Further information on diaphragm classifications and behavior can be found in AISC (2018a) and SDI (2015).

Composite Diaphragm Strength. Diaphragms should be designed to resist all forces associated with the collection and distribution of lateral forces to the lateral force-resisting system. In some cases, loads from other floors should also be included, such as at a level where a horizontal offset in the lateral force-resisting system exists. Several methods exist for determining the in-place shear strength of composite diaphragms. Three such methods are as follows:

(a) As determined for the combined strength of composite deck and concrete fill, including the considerations of composite deck configuration, as well as type and layout of deck attachments. One publication that is considered to provide such guidance is the SDI Diaphragm Design Manual (SDI, 2015). This publication covers many aspects of diaphragm design, including strength and stiffness calculations. Calculation procedures are also provided for alternative deck-to-framing connection methods, such as puddle welding and mechanical fasteners in cases where anchors are not used. Where stud anchors are used, stud shear strength values shall be as determined according to Section I8.

(b) As the thickness of concrete over the steel deck is increased, the shear strength can approach that for a concrete slab of the same thickness. For example, in composite floor deck diaphragms having cover depths between 2 in. (50 mm) and 6 in. (150 mm), measured shear stresses on the order of  $ 0.11\sqrt{f_{c}^{\prime}} $ , where  $ \sqrt{f_{c}^{\prime}} $  is in units of ksi, have been reported. In such cases, the diaphragm strength of concrete metal deck slabs can conservatively be based on the principles of reinforced concrete design (ACI, 2019) using the concrete and reinforcement above the metal deck ribs and ignoring the beneficial effect of the concrete in the flutes.

(c) Results from in-plane tests of filled diaphragms.

Collector Beams and Other Composite Elements. Horizontal diaphragm forces are transferred to the steel lateral force-resisting frame as axial forces in collector beams, which are also known as diaphragm struts or drag struts. The design of collector beams has not been addressed directly in this chapter. The rigorous design of composite collector beams is complex and few detailed guidelines exist on such members. Until additional research becomes available, a reasonable simplified design approach is provided as follows:

Force Application. Collector beams can be designed for the combined effects of axial load due to diaphragm forces, as well as flexure due to gravity and/or lateral loads. The effect of the vertical offset (eccentricity) between the plane of the diaphragm

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_18.md -->

and the centerline of the collector element results in additional shear reactions that should be investigated for design.

Axial Strength. The available axial strength of collector beams can be determined according to the noncomposite provisions of Chapter D and Chapter E. For compressive loading, collector beams are generally considered unbraced for buckling between braced points about their strong axis and fully braced by the composite diaphragm for buckling about the weak axis. The limit state of flexural-torsional buckling with bracing offset from the shear center, as addressed in Section E4, may also apply.

Flexural Strength. The available flexural strength of collector beams can be determined using either the composite provisions of Chapter I or the noncomposite provisions of Chapter F. It is recommended that all collector beams, even those designed as noncomposite members, should consider shear connector slip capacity as discussed in Commentary Section I3. This recommendation is intended to prevent designers from utilizing a small number of anchors solely to transfer diaphragm forces on a beam designed as a noncomposite member. Anchors designed only to transfer horizontal shear due to lateral forces will still be subjected to horizontal shear due to flexure from gravity loads superimposed on the composite section and could become overloaded under gravity loading conditions. Overloading the anchors could result in loss of stud strength, which could inhibit the ability of the collector beam to function as required for the transfer of diaphragm forces due to lateral loads.

Interaction. Combined axial force and flexure can be assessed using the interaction equations provided in Chapter H. As a reasonable simplification for design purposes, it is acceptable to use the noncomposite axial strength and the composite flexural strength in combination for determining interaction.

Shear Connection. It is not required to superimpose the horizontal shear due to lateral forces with the horizontal shear due to flexure for the determination of steel anchor requirements. The reasoning behind this methodology is twofold. First, the load combinations as presented in ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022) provide reduced live load levels for load combinations containing lateral loads. This reduction decreases the demand on the steel anchors and provides additional capacity for diaphragm force transfer. Secondly, horizontal shear due to flexure in a simply supported member flows in two directions. For a uniformly loaded beam, the shear flow emanates outward from the center of the beam as illustrated in Figure C-I7.1(a). Lateral loads on collector beams induce shear in one direction. As these shears are superimposed, the horizontal shears on one portion of the beam are increased and the horizontal shears on the opposite portion of the beam are decreased as illustrated in Figure C-I7.1(b). In lieu of additional research, it is considered acceptable for the localized additional loading of the steel anchors in the additive beam segment to be considered offset by the concurrent unloading of the steel anchors in the subtractive beam segment up to a force level corresponding to the summation of the nominal strengths of all studs placed on the beam. It is considered that the shear connectors in typical practical configurations possess an adequate degree of slip capacity to accommodate this mechanism.

### I 8. STEEL ANCHORS

### 1. General

This section covers the strength, placement, and limitations on the use of steel anchors in composite construction. The term "steel anchor," first introduced in the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), includes the traditional "shear connector," now defined as a "steel headed stud anchor" and a "steel channel anchor" both of which have been part of previous Specifications. Both steel headed stud anchors and hot-rolled steel channel anchors are addressed in the Specification. The design provisions for steel anchors are given for composite beams with solid slabs or with formed steel deck and for composite components. A composite component is defined as a member, connecting element, or assemblage in which steel and concrete elements work as a unit in the distribution of internal forces. This term excludes composite beams with solid slabs or formed steel deck. The provisions for composite components include the use of a resistance factor or safety factor applied to the nominal strength of the steel anchor, while for composite beams, the resistance factor and safety factor are part of the composite beam resistance and safety factor.

Steel headed stud anchors up to 1 in. (25 mm) in diameter are permitted for use in beams with solid slabs based on a review of available data and their history of successful performance in bridge applications. The limitation of  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm) anchors for all other conditions represents the limits of push-out data for decked members as well as the limits of applicability of the current composite component provisions. Though larger anchors for use in composite components are not addressed by this Specification, their strength may be determined by ACI 318, Chapter 17 (ACI, 2019).

Studs not located directly over the web of a beam tend to tear out of a thin flange before attaining full shear strength. To guard against this contingency, the size of a stud not located over the beam web is limited to  $ 2\frac{1}{2} $  times the flange thickness (Goble, 1968). The practical application of this limitation is to select only beams with flanges thicker than the stud diameter divided by 2.5.

Section I8.2 requires a minimum overall steel headed stud anchor height to the shank diameter ratio of 4 when calculating the nominal shear strength of a steel headed stud anchor in a composite beam. This requirement has been used in previous Specifications and has had a record of successful performance. For calculating the nominal shear strength of a steel headed stud anchor in other composite components, Section I8.3 increases this minimum ratio to 5 for normal weight concrete and 7 for lightweight concrete. Additional increases in the minimum ratio are required for computing the nominal tensile strength or the nominal strength for interaction of shear and tension in Section I8.3. The provisions of Section I8.3 also establish minimum edge distances and center-to-center spacings for steel headed stud anchors if the nominal strength equations in that section are to be used. These limits are established in recognition of the fact that only steel failure modes are checked in the calculation of the nominal anchor strengths in Equations I8-3, I8-4, and I8-5. Concrete failure modes are not checked explicitly in these equations (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a, 2010b), whereas concrete failure is checked in Equation I8-1. This is discussed further in Commentary Section I8.3.

### 2. Steel Anchors in Composite Beams

### 2 a. Strength of Steel Headed Stud Anchors

The present strength equations for composite beams and steel headed stud anchors are based on the considerable research that has been published, such as Jayas and Hosain (1988a, 1988b), Mottram and Johnson (1990), Easterling et al. (1993), and Roddenberry et al. (2002a). Equation I8-1 contains  $ R_{g} $  and  $ R_{p} $  factors to bring these composite beam strength requirements to a comparable level with other codes around the world. Other codes use a stud strength expression similar to this Specification, but the stud strength is reduced by a  $ \phi $  factor of 0.8 in the Canadian code (CSA, 2009) and by an even lower partial safety factor,  $ \phi = 0.60 $ , for the corresponding stud strength equations in Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2009). This Specification includes the stud anchor resistance factor as part of the overall composite beam resistance factor.

The majority of composite steel floor decks used today have a stiffening rib in the middle of each deck flute. Because of the stiffener, studs must be welded off-center in the deck rib. Studies have shown that steel studs behave differently depending upon their location within the deck rib (Lawson, 1992; Easterling et al., 1993;

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_21.md -->

Van der Sanden, 1996; Yuan, 1996; Johnson and Yuan, 1998; Roddenberry et al., 2002a, 2002b). The so-called "weak" (unfavorable) and "strong" (favorable) positions are illustrated in Figure C-I8.1. Furthermore, the maximum value shown in these studies for studs welded through steel deck is on the order of 0.7 to  $ 0.75F_{u}A_{sc} $ . Studs placed in the weak position have strengths as low as  $ 0.5F_{u}A_{sc} $ .

The strength of steel headed stud anchors installed in the ribs of concrete slabs on formed steel deck with the ribs oriented perpendicular to the steel beam is reasonably estimated by the strength of steel headed stud anchors computed from Equation I8-1, which sets the default value for steel headed stud anchor strength equal to that for the weak stud position. Both AISC (1997a) and the Steel Deck Institute (SDI, 2001) recommend that studs be detailed in the strong position, but ensuring that studs are placed in the strong position is not necessarily an easy task because it is not always easy for the installer to determine where along the beam the particular rib is located relative to the end, midspan, or point of zero shear. Therefore, the installer may not be clear on which location is the strong and which is the weak position.

In most composite floors designed today, the ultimate strength of the composite section is governed by the strength of the shear connection, as full composite action is typically not the most economical solution to resist the required strength. The degree of composite action, as represented by the ratio of the total shear connection strength divided by the lesser of the yield strength of the steel cross section and the compressive strength of the concrete slab,  $ \Sigma Q_{n}/\left[\min\left(F_{y}A_{s},0.85f_{c}^{\prime}A_{c}\right)\right] $ , influences the flexural strength as shown in Figure C-I8.2.

It can be seen from Figure C-I8.2 that a relatively large change in shear connection strength results in a much smaller change in flexural strength. Thus, formulating the influence of steel deck on shear anchor strength by conducting beam tests and back-calculating through the flexural model, as was done in the past, leads to an inaccurate assessment of stud strength when installed in metal deck.

The changes in steel headed stud anchor requirements that occurred in the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b) were not a result of either structural failures or performance problems. Designers concerned about the strength of existing structures based on earlier Specification requirements should note that the slope of the curve shown in Figure C-I8.2 is rather flat as the degree of composite action approaches one. Thus, even a large change in steel stud strength does not result in a proportional decrease of the flexural strength. In addition, the current expression does not account

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_188_1005_673_1171.jpg" ></div>

for all the possible shear force transfer mechanisms, primarily because many of them are difficult or impossible to quantify. However, as noted in Commentary Section I3.1, as the degree of composite action decreases, the deformation demands on steel studs increase. This effect is reflected by the increasing slope of the relationship shown in Figure C-I8.2 as the degree of composite action decreases. Thus, designers should consider the influence of increased ductility demand, when evaluating existing composite beams with less than 50% composite action.

The reduction factor,  $ R_{p} $ , for steel headed stud anchors used in composite beams with no decking was reduced from 1.0 to 0.75 in the 2010 AISC Specification. The methodology used for steel headed stud anchors that incorporates  $ R_{g} $  and  $ R_{p} $  was implemented in the 2005 AISC Specification. The research (Roddenberry et al., 2002a) in which the factors  $ R_{g} $  and  $ R_{p} $  were developed focused almost exclusively on cases involving the use of steel headed stud anchors welded through the steel deck. The research pointed to the likelihood that the solid slab case should use  $ R_{p} = 0.75 $ ; however, the body of test data had not been established to support the change. More recent research has shown that the 0.75 factor is appropriate (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a).

### 2 b. Strength of Steel Channel Anchors

Equation I8-2 is a modified form of the formula for the strength of channel anchors presented in Slutter and Driscoll (1965), which was based on the results of pushout tests and a few simply supported beam tests with solid slabs by Viest et al. (1952). The modification has extended its use to lightweight concrete.

Eccentricities need not be considered in the weld design for cases where the welds at the toe and heel of the channel are greater than  $ \frac{3}{16} $  in. (5 mm) and the anchor meets the following requirements:

 $$ 1.0\leq\frac{t_{f}}{t_{w}}\leq5.5 $$ 

 $$ \frac{H}{t_{w}}\geq8.0 $$ 

 $$ \frac{L_{c}}{t_{f}}\geq6.0 $$ 

 $$ 0.5\leq\frac{R}{t_{w}}\leq1.6 $$ 

where

H = height of anchor, in. (mm)

 $ L_{c}= $  length of anchor, in. (mm)

R = radius of the fillet between the flange and the web of the channel anchor, in. (mm)

tf = thickness of channel anchor flange, in. (mm)

 $ t_{w} $  = thickness of channel anchor web, in. (mm)

### 2 d. Detailing Requirements

Uniform spacing of steel anchors is permitted, except in the presence of heavy concentrated loads.

The minimum distances from the center of an anchor to a free edge in the direction of the shear force that are shown in this Specification are based on data reported by Nelson Stud Welding Division (Nelson, 1977). Data for various steel headed stud anchor diameters, concrete compressive strengths, and unit weights are reported. The provisions selected for inclusion in this Specification result in no reduced strength for  $ \frac{3}{4} $ -in.- (19-mm-) diameter steel headed stud anchors in 4 ksi (28 MPa) concrete, which were deemed to be representative of most composite beam construction. Other values are available in the report for use by the designer if deemed to be more applicable.

The minimum spacing of anchors along the length of the beam, in both flat soffit concrete slabs and in formed steel deck with ribs parallel to the beam, is six diameters (6d); this spacing reflects the development of shear planes in the concrete slab (Ollgaard et al., 1971). Because most test data are based on the minimum transverse spacing of four diameters (4d), this transverse spacing was set as the minimum permitted. If the steel beam flange is narrow, this spacing requirement may be achieved by staggering the studs with a minimum transverse spacing of three diameters (3d) between the staggered row of studs. When deck ribs are parallel to the beam and the design requires more studs than can be placed in the rib, the deck may be split so that adequate spacing is available for stud installation. Figure C-I8.3 shows possible anchor arrangements.

### 3. Steel Anchors in Composite Components

This section applies to steel headed stud anchors used primarily in the load transfer (connection) region of composite compression members and beam-columns, encased and filled composite beams, composite coupling beams, and composite walls, where the steel and concrete are working compositely within a member. An example of the use of steel headed stud anchors in a composite wall is shown in Figure C-I8.4. In such cases, it is possible that the steel headed stud anchor will be subjected to shear, tension, or interaction of shear and tension. As the strength of the steel headed stud anchors in the load transfer region must be assessed directly, rather than implicitly within the strength assessment of a composite member, a resistance or safety factor should be applied, comparable to the design of bolted connections in Chapter J.

These provisions are not intended for hybrid construction where the steel and concrete are not working compositely, such as with embed plates. Section I8.2 specifies the strength of steel headed stud anchors embedded in a solid concrete slab or in a concrete slab with formed steel deck in a composite beam.

Data from a wide range of experiments indicate that the failure of steel headed stud anchors subjected to shear occurs in the steel shank or weld in a large percentage of cases if the ratio of the overall height-to-shank diameter of the steel headed stud anchor is greater than 5 for normal weight concrete. In the case of lightweight concrete, the necessary minimum ratio between the overall height of the stud and the diameter increases up to 7 (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a). Use of anchors meeting the dimensional limitations for shear loading preclude the limit state of concrete pryout as defined by ACI 318, Chapter 17 (ACI, 2019). A similarly large percentage of failures occur in the steel shank or weld of steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension or interaction of shear and tension if the ratio of the overall height to shank diameter of the steel headed stud anchor is greater than 8 for normal weight concrete. In the case of lightweight concrete, the necessary minimum ratio between the overall height of the stud and the diameter increases up to 10 for steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010b). For steel headed stud anchors subjected to interaction of shear and tension in lightweight concrete, there are so few experiments available that it is not possible to discern sufficiently when the steel material will control the failure mode. For the strength of steel headed stud anchors

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_149_929_711_1171.jpg" ></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, August 1, 2022 AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_25.md -->

in lightweight concrete subjected to interaction of shear and tension, it is recommended that the provisions of ACI 318, Chapter 17, be used. Use of steel headed stud anchors meeting the dimensional limitations for tension loading preclude the limit states of concrete breakout and pryout as defined by ACI 318, Chapter 17, where analysis indicates no cracking at service load levels, as would generally be the case in compression zones and regions of high confinement typical of composite construction. Where the engineer determines that concrete cracking under service load levels can occur, it is recommended that the provisions of ACI 318, Chapter 17, be used.

The use of edge distances in ACI 318, Chapter 17, to compute the strength of a steel anchor subjected to concrete crushing failure is complex. It is rare in composite construction that there is a nearby edge that is not uniformly supported in a way that prevents the possibility of concrete breakout failure due to a close edge. Thus, for brevity, the provisions in this Specification simplify the assessment of whether it is warranted to check for a concrete failure mode. Additionally, if an edge is supported uniformly, as would be common in composite construction, it is assumed that a concrete failure mode will not occur due to the edge condition. Thus, if these provisions are to be used, it is important that it be deemed by the engineer that a concrete breakout failure mode in shear is directly avoided through having the edges perpendicular to the line of force supported, and the edges parallel to the line of force sufficiently distant that concrete breakout through a side edge is not deemed viable. For loading in shear, the determination of whether breakout failure in the concrete is a viable

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_18_img_in_image_box_220_639_642_1140.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-I8.4. Typical reinforcement detailing in a composite wall for steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_26.md -->

failure mode for the steel headed stud anchor is left to the engineer. Alternatively, the provisions call for required anchor reinforcement with provisions comparable to those of ACI 318, Section 17.5.2.1. In addition, the provisions of the applicable building code or ACI 318, Chapter 17, may be used directly to compute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor.

The steel limit states, resistance factors, and corresponding safety factors covered in this section match with the corresponding limit states of ACI 318, Chapter 17, although they were assessed independently for these provisions. As only steel limit states are required to be checked if there are no edge conditions, experiments that satisfy the minimum height-to-diameter ratio, but that included failure of the steel headed stud anchor either in the steel or in the concrete, were included in the assessment of the resistance and safety factors (Pallarés and Hajjar, 2010a, 2010b).

For steel headed stud anchors subjected to tension or combined shear and tension interaction, it is recommended that anchor reinforcement always be included around the stud to mitigate premature failure in the concrete. If the ratio of the diameter of the head of the stud to the shank diameter is too small, the provisions call for use of ACI 318, Chapter 17, to compute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor. If the distance to the edge of the concrete or the distance to the neighboring anchor is too small, the provisions call for required anchor reinforcement with provisions comparable to those of ACI 318, Section 17.5.2.1. Alternatively, the provisions of the applicable building code or ACI 318, Chapter 17, may also be used directly to compute the strength of the steel headed stud anchor.

### 4. Performance-Based Alternative for the Design of Shear Connection

In 2022, provisions for performance-based design of the shear connection were introduced. The provisions provide requirements for quantifying the mechanical properties of the shear connection. They can be used to overcome the geometric limitations, such as deck profile height or connector spacing contained in Sections I3.2c, I8.1, and I8.2. Furthermore, the same principle applies to the material limitations of the shear connection types currently prescribed by the Specification. Also, they can be used to quantify the necessary design parameters for alternatives, such as those incorporating nonwelded fasteners, welded plate connectors, specific geometric features of the formed steel deck, etc. Another benefit of the performance-based evaluation path is the ability to directly capture incidental contribution on the performance of various elements of the shear connection assembly, such as the deck profile, otherwise not explicitly recognized by the Specification. Finally, accuracy, reliability, and economy can be improved by generating available strength, performance characteristics, and constitutive models relative to each individual configuration of shear connection. The intent of the provisions prescribing performance-based alternatives for the design of the shear connection is not to alter the specification provision governing the determination of flexural strength of the composite member whose shear connection strength is established through the performance-based path.

These provisions provide two implementation paths—one based on assurance of equivalent performance relative to the shear connections covered by the scope of Section I8.3, and the other based on a direct analytical implementation of performance

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_27.md -->

characteristics that either do not meet, or exceed those characteristic for the methods of shear connections currently stipulated by Section I8.3.

Aside from the relevant shear connection strength,  $ Q_{n} $ , the performance of the shear connection is further dictated by the presumptive values of slip capacity, composite beam or component reliability, geometric and material constraints of evaluated shear connection, and shear connection stiffness.

### 4 a. Test Standard

The Specification provisions relative to shear connection strength have traditionally been based on the body of data generated through push-out tests (Ollgaard et al., 1971; Lyons et al., 1994; Rodenberry et al., 2002a, 2002b). While no formal or codified test protocol had traditionally existed aside from Annex A of EN-1994-1-1 (CEN, 2009), the key elements of the procedure have remained relatively unchanged. Evaluation services, such as the International Code Council Evaluation Services (ICC-ES) and the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials Uniform Evaluation Services (IAPMO UES), have published evaluation criteria leading to the establishment of formal procedures for quantifying shear connection mechanical properties (IAPMO, 2015; IAPMO, 2018). The most typical implementation venue for these protocols involves a pursuit of an evaluation report, which serves as a basis of acceptance by the authority having jurisdiction.

To facilitate the development of its own composite design provisions, AISI has published AISI S923 (AISI, 2020a), a testing standard for the assessment of shear connection performance in composite steel-concrete members. This standard serves as the basis of evaluation using this provision of the Specification, though comparable alternatives, depending on their scope and provided their acceptability to the authority having jurisdiction, such as those aforementioned, could be employed. AISI also published a companion standard AISI S924 (AISI, 2020b) for the assessment of composite section stiffness, which can be employed in conjunction with any particular method of shear connection.

Other similar protocols are provided by EN1994-1-1 Annex A (CEN, 2009), IAPMO UES EC-023 (IAPMO, 2015), and EC-033 (IAPMO, 2018). AISI S923 is general in scope. The other protocols mentioned, while equivalent in application, are generally specific in terminology and configuration to specific types of shear connectors. The users, as an alternative, may for convenience choose to apply these other protocols instead of AISI S923.

### 4 b. Nominal and Available Strength

Nominal strength of the shear connection is necessary for the calculation of composite member connection strength. Available strength is used for the connection component strength. The coefficient of 0.85 represents an adjustment to account for the statistical bias factor (Mujagic and Easterling, 2009) relative to the strength computation model for headed shear studs developed by Rodenberry et al. (2002a, 2002b). The application of the bias factor adjustment, in addition to the acceptance criteria outlined in Section I8.4d, assures the usage of the strength reduction factors presently stipulated by this Specification. Alternatively, the bias factor can be

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_28.md -->

removed and a separate strength reduction factor can be calculated using the data directly, in lieu of those provided by this Specification.

### 4 c. Shear Connection Slip Capacity

Starting with its 2016 edition, the Specification has explicitly required the consideration of shear connection ductility, also defined by the term slip capacity, in the assessment of composite beam available strength. The commentary provides additional guidelines on the methods for considering shear connection slip capacity. Many typical shear connection assemblies exhibit a nominally elastic-perfectly-plastic load-slip response, with a slightly descending response curve. The factor of 0.95, also commonly used in other similar contexts, provides for the consideration of capturing considerable and structurally useful slip capacity and an inconsequential loss of strength in a ductile assembly.

### 4 d. Acceptance Criteria

The conditions (1) through (3), in addition to the requirements of Sections I8.4a through I8.4c, aim at providing for the usage of alternative shear connection methods based on equivalency in performance to the methods currently recognized by Section I8.3.

Reliability assessment of composite beams, even in its simplest first-order second-moment formulation, is a complex effort, impractical to undertake on a case-by-case basis, greatly influenced by geometric parameters, mechanical properties of the components of a composite section, and the consequent position of the neutral axis in the section. When composite beams are partially composite, the coefficient of variation relative to the influence of shear connection on the composite beam strength becomes a function whose influence varies based on the degree of composite action, the governing failure mode, and other factors. The strength reduction factor currently stipulated by the Specification relative to the strength prediction model for the shear connection, when used for connection component design, or the strength reduction factor used in composite beams based on the model by Roddenberry et al. (2002a, 2002b) reflect an upper limit of 0.18 on the coefficient of variation relative to the influence of shear connection, along with a governing bias factor of 1.17, characteristic for solid slab configurations (Mujagic and Easterling, 2009). The original reliability analyses leading to the current strength reduction factor operated with a considerable data space. As assessment of the performance of individual connection configurations is typically based on a limited number of tests, the effect of the standard error of the mean could become pronounced. For this reason, two thresholds were provided scaling the coefficient of variation of 0.18 to 0.15 and 0.09 for the data space of nine and four replicate tests, respectively.

The Specification requirement to establish the effect of shear connection ductility still applies. The value of 0.25 in. (6 mm) represents the threshold ductility value for a  $ \frac{3}{4} $ -in.- (19-mm-) diameter steel headed stud anchor in a solid slab upon which the previous Specification editions have implicitly been based. Alternative methods of shear connection that meet this requirement are subject to the same commentary guidelines on ductility as provided for the conventional shear connection in Commentary Section I3.2d.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_18/doc_29.md -->

While elastic shear stiffness is traditionally related to serviceability considerations, the concern for an early departure from a typical load-slip relationship, despite the ductility ultimately achieved, could cause premature discontinuities in the composite section strain diagram and invalidate basic design and analysis assumptions. For this reason, the acceptance limit on minimum shear elastic stiffness has been imposed. While subject to the influence of variables, such as the modulus of elasticity of steel and the surrounding concrete, stud position relative to deck rib, etc., the value of 2,000 kip/in. (350 000 N/mm), determined as the slope of the load-slip line between the points of 10 and 40% of the ultimate load, is a typical upper-bound value seen in push-out tests (Lyons et al., 1994; Rodenberry et al., 2002a, 2002b) and predicted by the proposed analytical models (Oehlers and Coughlan, 1986; Xu and Liu, 2019).

Condition (4) allows the Specification user to circumvent the acceptance conditions (1) through (3) and the application of the bias factor of Section I8.4b by capturing the effects of different performance thresholds directly in the design, whether determining the available or required strength.

# CHAPTER J DESIGN OF CONNECTIONS

Chapter J includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Section J2 clarifies that this Specification takes precedence over AWS Structural Welding Code—Steel, AWS D1.1/D1.1M, when in conflict.

(2) Requirements for use of low-hydrogen electrodes related to minimum size fillet welds have been revised.

(3) Requirements for including increased penetration of fillet and partial-joint-penetration groove welds in the effective throat have been revised.

(4) The strengths for partial-joint-penetration groove-welded column splices and other partial-joint-penetration groove-welded column conditions designed to bear have been combined.

(5) The provisions for directional strength increase for transversely loaded fillet welds have been rewritten and the increase prohibited for use at the ends of rectangular hollow structural sections (HSS).

(6) Section J3.2 clarifies that this Specification takes precedence over the RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts when in conflict.

(7) Designation of bolt strength groups have been changed from Groups A, B, and C to Groups 120, 150, and 200, reflecting their nominal strengths.

(8) Group 144 (ASTM F3148) bolts and the “combined” installation method have been added.

(9) An alternative tensile strength based on the net tensile area of bolts has been added.

(10) Bearing of through bolts, with plies not in firm contact, on HSS sidewalls has been clarified.

The provisions of Chapter J cover the design of connections not subjected to cyclic loads. Wind and other environmental loads are generally not considered to be cyclic loads. The provisions generally apply to connections other than HSS and box sections. See Chapter K for provisions specific to HSS and box-section connections, and Appendix 3 for fatigue provisions.

### J1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

### 1. Design Basis

In the absence of defined design loads, a minimum design load should be considered. Historically, a value of 10 kips (44 kN) for LRFD and 6 kips (27 kN) for ASD have been used as reasonable values. For smaller elements such as lacing, sag rods, girts, or similar small members, a load more appropriate to the size and use of the part should be used. Both design requirements and construction loads should be considered when specifying minimum loads for connections.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_1.md -->

### 2. Simple Connections

Simple connections are considered in this section and Section B3.4a. In Section B3.4a, simple connections are defined in an idealized manner for the purpose of analysis. The assumptions made in the analysis determine the outcome of the analysis that serves as the basis for design; for connections, that means the force and deformation demands that the connection must resist. This section focuses on the actual proportioning of the connection elements to achieve the required resistance. Thus, Section B3.4a establishes the modeling assumptions that determine the design forces and deformations for use in Section J1.2.

This section and Section B3.4a are not mutually exclusive. If a “simple” connection is assumed for analysis, the actual connection, as finally designed, must perform consistent with that assumption. A simple connection must be able to meet the required rotation and must not introduce strength and stiffness that significantly alters the rotational response.

### 3. Moment Connections

Two types of moment connections are defined in Section B3.4b: fully restrained (FR) and partially restrained (PR). FR moment connections must have sufficient strength and stiffness to transfer moment and maintain the angle between connected members. PR moment connections are designed to transfer moments but also allow rotation between connected members as the loads are resisted. The response characteristics of a PR connection must be documented in the technical literature or established by analytical or experimental means. The component elements of a PR connection must have sufficient strength, stiffness, and deformation capacity to satisfy the design assumptions.

### 4. Compression Members with Bearing Joints

The provisions in Section J1.4(b), for compression members other than columns finished to bear, are intended to account for member out-of-straightness and also to provide a degree of robustness in the structure to resist unintended or accidental lateral loadings that may not have been considered explicitly in the design.

A provision analogous to that in Section J1.4(b)(1), requiring that splice materials and connectors have an available strength of at least 50% of the required compressive strength, has been in the AISC Specification since 1946 (AISC, 1946). The current Specification clarifies this requirement by stating that the force for proportioning the splice materials and connectors is a tensile force. This avoids uncertainty as to how to handle situations where compression on the connection imposes no force on the connectors.

Proportioning the splice materials and connectors for 50% of the required member strength is simple, but can be very conservative. In Section J1.4(b)(2), the Specification offers an alternative that addresses directly the design intent of these provisions. The lateral load of 2% of the required compressive strength of the member simulates the effect of a kink at the splice caused by an end finished slightly out-of-square or other construction condition. Proportioning the connection for the resulting moment and shear also provides a degree of robustness in the structure.

### 5. Splices in Heavy Sections

Solidified but still hot weld metal contracts significantly as it cools to ambient temperature. Shrinkage of large groove welds between elements that are not free to move so as to accommodate the shrinkage causes strains in the material adjacent to the weld that can exceed the yield point strain. In thick material, the weld shrinkage is restrained in the thickness direction and in the width and length directions causing triaxial stresses to develop that may inhibit the ability to deform in a ductile manner. Under these conditions, the possibility of brittle fracture increases.

The web-to-flange intersection and the web center of heavy hot-rolled shapes, as well as the interior portions of heavy plates, may contain a coarser grain structure and/or lower notch toughness than other areas of these products.

When splicing hot-rolled shapes with flange thickness exceeding 2 in. (50 mm) or heavy welded built-up members, these potentially harmful weld shrinkage strains can be avoided by using bolted splices or fillet-welded lap splices as shown in Figure C-J1.1, or splices that combine a welded and bolted detail. Details and techniques that perform well for materials of modest thickness usually must be changed or supplemented by more demanding requirements when welding thick material.

The provisions of AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020) are minimum requirements that apply to most structural welding situations. However, when designing and fabricating welded splices of hot-rolled shapes with flange thicknesses exceeding 2 in. (50 mm) and similar built-up cross sections, special consideration must be given to all aspects of the welded splice detail:

(a) Notch-toughness requirements are required to be specified for tension members as discussed in Commentary Section A3.1d.

(b) Generously sized weld access holes, as specified in Section J1.6, are required to provide increased relief from concentrated weld shrinkage strains to avoid close juncture of welds in orthogonal directions and to provide adequate clearance for the exercise of high-quality workmanship in hole preparation, welding, and for ease of inspection.

(c) Preheating for thermal cutting is required to minimize the formation of a hard surface layer. See Section M2.2.

<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-J1.1. Alternative splices that minimize weld restraint tensile stresses.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_3.md -->

(d) Grinding of copes and weld access holes to bright metal to remove the hard surface layer is required.

In addition to tension splices of truss chord members and tension flanges of flexural members, other joints fabricated from heavy sections subjected to tension should be given special consideration during design and fabrication.

Alternative details that do not generate shrinkage strains can be used. In connections where the forces transferred approach the member strength, directly welded groove joints may still be the most effective choice.

Until 1999, the Specification mandated that backing bars and weld tabs be removed from all splices of heavy sections. These requirements were deliberately removed, being judged unnecessary and, in some situations, potentially resulting in more harm than good. This Specification still permits the engineer of record to specify their removal when this is judged appropriate. The previous requirement for the removal of backing bars necessitated, in some situations, that such operations be performed out-of-position; that is, the welding required to restore the backgouged area had to be applied in the overhead position. This may necessitate different equipment for gaining access, different welding equipment, processes and procedures, and other practical constraints. When box sections made of plate are spliced, access to the interior side, which is necessary for backing removal, is typically impossible.

Weld tabs that are left in place on splices act as “short attachments” and attract little stress. Even though it is acknowledged that weld tabs might contain regions of inferior quality weld metal, the stress concentration effect is minimized because little stress is conducted through the attachment.

Previous editions of this Specification required magnetic particle or dye-penetrant inspection of thermally cut weld access holes for splices in heavy sections. This requirement was deliberately removed as anecdotal evidence suggested this inspection was not necessary because cracks from thermal cutting rarely occurred when the other Specification requirements were met. The previously prescribed magnetic particle testing or penetrant testing was replaced in Table N5.4-3 with a requirement for visual inspection of weld access holes after welding.

### 6. Weld Access Holes

Weld access holes are frequently required in the fabrication of structural components. The geometry of these structural details can affect the components' performance. The size and shape of beam copes and weld access holes can have a significant effect on the ease of depositing sound weld metal, the ability to conduct nondestructive examinations, and the magnitude of the stresses at the geometric discontinuities produced by these details.

Weld access holes used to facilitate welding operations are required to have a minimum length from the toe of the weld preparation equal to the greater of 1.5 times the thickness of the material in which the hole is made or  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm) as shown in Figure C-J1.2. This minimum length is expected to accommodate a significant amount of the weld shrinkage strains at the web-to-flange intersection.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_4.md -->

The height of the weld access hole must provide sufficient clearance for ease of welding and inspection and must be large enough to allow the welder to deposit sound weld metal through and beyond the web. A weld access hole height equal to 1.0 times the thickness of the material with the access hole, but not less than  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm), has been judged to satisfy these welding and inspection requirements. The height of the weld access hole need not exceed 2 in. (50 mm).

The geometry of the reentrant corner between the web and the flange determines the level of stress concentration at that location. A  $ 90^{\circ} $  reentrant corner having a very small radius produces a very high stress concentration that may lead to rupture of the flange. Consequently, to minimize the stress concentration at this location, the edge of the web is sloped or curved from the surface of the flange to the reentrant surface of the weld access hole.

Stress concentrations along the perimeter of weld access holes also can affect the performance of the joint. Consequently, weld access holes are required to be free of stress raisers such as notches and gouges. The nondestructive testing (NDT) requirement of access holes in earlier editions of the Specification has been removed in response to reports that these examinations had revealed no defects.

Stress concentrations at web-to-flange intersections of built-up shapes can be decreased by terminating the weld away from the access hole. Thus, for built-up shapes

1. Length: Greater of  $ 1.5t_{w} $  or  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm)



2. Height: Greater of  $ 1.0t_{w} $  or  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm), but need not exceed 2 in. (50 mm)

3. R:  $ \frac{1}{2} $  in. (10 mm) min. Grind the thermally cut surfaces of weld access holes in heavy shapes as defined in Sections A3.1d and A3.1e.

4. Slope 'a' forms a transition from the web to the flange. Slope 'b' may be horizontal.

5. The bottom of the top flange is to be contoured to permit the tight fit of backing bars where they are to be used.

6. The web-to-flange weld of built-up members is to be held back a distance of at least the weld size from the edge of the access hole.

with fillet welds or partial-joint-penetration groove welds that join the web to the flange, the weld access hole may terminate perpendicular to the flange, provided that the weld is terminated a distance equal to or greater than one weld size away from the access hole.

### 7. Placement of Welds and Bolts

Slight eccentricities between the gravity axis of single- and double-angle members and the center of gravity of connecting bolts or rivets have long been ignored as having negligible effect on the static strength of such members. Tests have shown that similar practice is warranted in the case of welded members in statically loaded structures (Gibson and Wake, 1942). However, the fatigue life of eccentrically loaded welded angles has been shown to be very short (Klöppel and Seeger, 1964). Notches at the roots of fillet welds are harmful when alternating tensile stresses are normal to the axis of the weld, as could occur due to bending when axial cyclic loading is applied to angles with end welds not balanced about the neutral axis. Accordingly, balanced welds are required when such members are subjected to cyclic loading as shown in Figure C-J1.3.

### 8. Bolts in Combination with Welds

As in previous editions, this Specification does not permit bolts or rivets to share the load with welds except for conditions where shear is resisted at the faying surface. In joints where the strength is based on the strength of bolts and welds acting together, the compatibility of deformations of the various components of the connection at the ultimate load level are important factors in determining the connection strength. Physical tests (Kulak and Grondin, 2003) and finite element models (Shi et al., 2011) have shown that bolts designed as part of a slip-critical connection and properly tightened according to the requirements for a slip-critical connection can share the load with longitudinal fillet welds, provided a reasonable proportion of the load is carried by each. The limits established are 50% minimum for the welds and 33% minimum for the high-strength bolts. The strength of transverse welds is not permitted to be included with the strength of bolts because these welds have less ductility. The provisions of this section are generally intended to be applied in cases where retrofit

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_19_img_in_image_box_162_884_701_1168.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-J1.3. Balanced welds.</div>

work is required to accommodate higher design loads, or cases where the mean slip coefficient in the field may not have complied with the value assumed in the design. Special testing is required according to Appendix A of the RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts (RCSC, 2020) in such cases to validate the value of the slip coefficient,  $ \mu $ , used in the final retrofitted design.

The intent of this Specification, as prescribed in the second paragraph of this section, is that the combined joint will provide the required strength just prior to when the welds fracture, which defines the ultimate load level. The ultimate load is defined by the capacity of the welds and the slip resistance from the bolt pretension clamping force. No additional bearing or tearout capacity check is required. The use of a single resistance factor,  $ \phi = 0.75 $ , or safety factor,  $ \Omega = 2.00 $ , on the nominal strength of the bolts and welds combined is intended to improve the reliability of the connection compared to the use of the higher resistance factor,  $ \phi = 1.00 $ , and lower safety factor,  $ \Omega = 1.50 $ , permitted for standard holes in slip-critical bolted connections alone. For existing connections with high-strength bolts originally tightened by other methods than turn-of-nut, an additional  $ \frac{1}{2} $  turn for ASTM F3125/F3125M Grades A325 or A325M and  $ \frac{1}{2} $  turn for Grades A490 or A490M bolts would allow the bolts to be considered pretensioned by turn-of-nut relative to this section. Over-rotation of a bolt is not cause for rejection per the RCSC Specification. The additional rotation may occasionally result in bolt rupture, which will occur at the time the bolts are rotated. Broken bolts can be replaced with equivalent bolts installed using the turn-of-nut method. Note that the connection strength need not be taken as less than the strength of the bolts alone or the strength of the welds alone. The heat of welding near bolts will not alter the mechanical properties of the bolts.

The restrictions on bolts in combination with welds do not apply to typical bolted and welded beam-to-girder and beam-to-column connections, and other comparable connections where the bolts and welds are used on separate faying surfaces (Kulak et al., 1987).

### 10. High-Strength Bolts in Combination with Existing Rivets

When high-strength bolts are used in combination with rivets, the ductility of the rivets permits the direct addition of the strengths of the two fastener types.

### J2. WELDS AND WELDED JOINTS

Provisions of this Specification related to welds are predicated on compliance with AWS D1.1/D1.1M, Structural Welding Code—Steel (AWS, 2020), hereafter referred to as AWS D1.1/D1.1M, except where those provisions differ from this Specification.

Examples of provisions in this Specification that vary from the AWS D1.1/D1.1M are as follows:

(a) Dimensions for weld access holes are defined differently. This Specification has a  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm) minimum access hole length.

(b) This Specification provides rules for permitting an increase in effective throat of fillet welds to account for penetration.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_7.md -->

(c) This Specification permits taking the outside radius, R, of hollow structural sections (HSS) for the purpose of calculating the size of flare groove welds as twice the nominal thickness of the HSS. When R is less than  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm), only the reinforcing over a flare bevel is counted for strength.

(d) Nominal stresses and permitted filler metal strength levels vary between this Specification and AWS D1.1/D1.1M.

(e) This Specification provides design and fabrication provisions and allowable cyclic stress ranges for categories of cyclically loaded connections, including some bolted connections.

(f) This Specification has provisions for reentrant corners for copes in beams.

(g) This Specification has provisions for cut surfaces of galvanized members, including grinding and inspection.

(h) This Specification has provisions regarding what inspections are required that are more explicit than the provisions of AWS D1.1/D1.1M.

Selection of weld type, complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove weld, fillet weld, or partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove weld, depends on base connection geometry (butt-joint versus T- or corner-joint), in addition to required strength, and other issues discussed in the following. Notch effects and the ability to evaluate with nondestructive testing may affect joint selection for cyclically loaded joints or joints expected to deform plastically.

### 1. Groove Welds

### 1 a. Effective Area

Tables J2.1 and J2.2 show that the effective throat of PJP and flare groove welds is dependent upon the weld process and the position of the weld. It is recommended that the design drawings show either the required strength or the required effective throat size and allow the fabricator to select the process and determine the position required to meet the specified requirements. Effective throats larger than those in Table J2.2 can be qualified by tests. Weld reinforcement is not used in determining the effective throat of a groove weld, but reinforcing fillets on T- and corner-joints are accounted for in the effective throat. See AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 4 (AWS, 2020).

### 1 b. Limitations

Table J2.3 gives the minimum effective throat thickness of a PJP groove weld. Notice that for PJP groove welds Table J2.3 goes up to a plate thickness of over 6 in. (150 mm) and a minimum weld throat of  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (16 mm), whereas for fillet welds, Table J2.4 goes up to a plate thickness of over  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm) and a minimum leg size of fillet weld of only  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm). The additional thickness for PJP groove welds is intended to provide for reasonable proportionality between weld and material thickness. The use of single-sided PJP groove welds in joints subjected to rotation about the toe of the weld is discouraged.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_8.md -->

### 2. Fillet Welds

### 2 a. Effective Area

The effective throat of a fillet weld does not include the weld reinforcement, nor any penetration beyond the weld root. Some welding procedures produce a consistent penetration beyond the root of the weld. This penetration contributes to the strength of the weld. However, it is necessary to demonstrate that the weld procedure to be used produces this increased penetration. This is done for mechanized or automated procedures by welding a test joint and sectioning that joint in three places. Consistency of penetration along the joint is essential and the minimum penetration achieved is the maximum permitted to be considered in design of the weld.

### 2 b. Limitations

Table J2.4 provides the minimum size of a fillet weld for a given thickness of the thinner part joined. The requirements are not based on strength considerations, but on the quench effect of thick material on small welds. Very rapid cooling of weld metal may result in a loss of ductility. Furthermore, the restraint to weld metal shrinkage provided by thick material may result in weld cracking.

The use of the thinner part to determine the minimum size weld is based on the prevalence of the use of filler metal considered to be "low hydrogen." Because a  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) fillet weld is the largest that can be deposited in a single pass by the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process and still be considered prequalified under AWS D1.1/D1.1M,  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) applies to all material greater than  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm) in thickness, but minimum preheat and interpass temperatures are required by AWS D1.1/D1.1M. The design drawings should reflect these minimum sizes and the production welds should reflect these minimum sizes.

For thicker members in lap joints, it is possible for the welder to melt away the upper corner, resulting in a weld that appears to be full size but actually lacks the required weld throat dimension as shown in Figure C-J2.1(a). On thinner members, the full weld throat is likely to be achieved, even if the edge is melted away. Accordingly, when the plate is  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) or thicker, the maximum fillet weld size is  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) less than the plate thickness, t, which is sufficient so that the edge remains as shown in Figure C-J2.1(b).

By providing a minimum lap of five times the thickness of the thinner part of a lap joint, the resulting rotation of the joint when pulled will not be excessive, as shown in Figure C-J2.2, where the condition shown in the right-hand figure subjects the fillet weld to torsion. Fillet welded lap joints under tension tend to open and apply a tearing action at the root of the weld as shown in Figure C-J2.3(b), unless restrained by a force, F, as shown in Figure C-J2.3(a). The minimum length reduces stresses due to Poisson effects.

The use of single-sided fillet welds in joints subjected to rotation around the toe of the weld is discouraged. End returns are not essential for developing the full length of fillet-welded connections and have a negligible effect on their strength. Their use has been encouraged so that the weld size is maintained over the length of the weld.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_9.md -->

to enhance the fatigue resistance of cyclically loaded flexible end connections, and to increase the plastic deformation capability of such connections.

The weld strength database on which the Specification was developed had no end returns. This includes the study reported in Higgins and Preece (1968), the seat angle tests in Lyse and Schreiner (1935), the seat and top angle tests in Lyse and Gibson (1937), the tests on beam webs welded directly to a column or girder by fillet welds in Johnston and Deits (1942), and the tests on eccentrically loaded welded connections reported by Butler et al. (1972). Hence, the current strength values and joint

design models do not require end returns when the required weld size is provided. Johnston and Green (1940) noted that movement consistent with the design assumption of no end restraint (in other words, joint flexibility) was enhanced without end returns. They also verified that greater plastic deformation of the connection was achieved when end returns existed, although the strength was not significantly different.

When longitudinal fillet welds parallel to the stress are used to transmit the load to the end of an axially loaded member, the welds are termed "end-loaded." Typical examples of such welds include, but are not limited to, (a) longitudinally welded lap joints at the end of axially loaded members, (b) welds attaching bearing stiffeners, and (c) similar cases. Typical examples of longitudinally loaded fillet welds that are not considered end-loaded include, but are not limited to, (a) welds that connect plates or shapes to form built-up cross sections in which the shear force is applied to each increment of length of weld depending upon the distribution of the shear along the length of the member and (b) welds attaching beam web connection angles and shear plates because the flow of shear force from the beam or girder web to the weld is essentially uniform throughout the weld length; that is, the weld is not end-loaded despite the fact that it is loaded parallel to the weld axis. Additionally, the reduction coefficient,  $ \beta $ , does not apply to welds attaching stiffeners to webs because the stiffeners and welds are not subjected to calculated axial stress but merely serve to keep the web flat.

The distribution of stress along the length of end-loaded fillet welds is not uniform and is dependent upon complex relationships between the stiffness of the longitudinal fillet weld relative to the stiffness of the connected materials. Experience has shown that when the length of the weld is equal to approximately 100 times the weld size or less, it is reasonable to assume that the full length is effective. As shown in Figure C-J2.4, for weld lengths greater than 100 times the weld size, the effective length should be taken as less than the actual length. The reduction factor,  $ \beta $ , provided in Section J2.2b is the equivalent to that given in CEN (2005a), which is a

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_19_img_in_chart_box_207_855_650_1146.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-J2.4. Effective weld length.</div>

simplified approximation of exponential formulas developed by finite element studies and tests performed in Europe over many years. The provision is based on the combined consideration of the nominal strength for fillet welds with leg size less than  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) and of a judgment-based serviceability limit of slightly less than  $ \frac{1}{32} $  in. (1 mm) displacement at the end of the weld for welds with leg size  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) and larger. Given the empirically derived mathematical form of the  $ \beta $  factor, as the ratio of weld length to weld size, w, increases beyond 300, the effective length of the weld begins to decrease, illogically causing a weld of greater length to have progressively less strength. Therefore, the effective length is taken as  $ 0.6(300)w = 180w $  when the weld length is greater than 300 times the leg size.

In most cases, fillet weld terminations do not affect the strength or serviceability of connections. However, in certain cases the disposition of welds affects the planned function of the connection, and notches may affect the static strength and the resistance to crack initiation if cyclic loads of sufficient magnitude and frequency occur. For these cases, termination details at the end of the joint are specified to provide the desired profile and performance. In cases where profile and notches are less critical, terminations are permitted to run to the end. In most cases, stopping the weld short of the end of the joint will not reduce the strength of the weld. The small loss of weld area due to stopping the weld short of the end of the joint by one to two weld sizes is not typically considered in the calculation of weld strength. Only short weld lengths will be significantly affected by this.

The following situations require special attention:

(1) For lapped joints where one part extends beyond the end or edge of the part to which it is welded and if the parts are subjected to calculated tensile stress at the start of the overlap, it is important that the weld terminate a short distance from the stressed edge. For one typical example, the lap joint between the tee chord and the web members of a truss, the weld should not extend to the edge of the tee stem (see Figure C-J2.5). The best technique to avoid inadvertent notches at this critical location is to strike the welding arc at a point slightly back from the

edge and proceed with welding in the direction away from the edge (see Figure C-J2.6). Where framing angles extend beyond the end of the beam web to which they are welded, the free end of the beam web is subjected to zero stress; thus, it is permissible for the fillet weld to extend continuously across the top end, along the side, and along the bottom end of the angle to the extreme end of the beam (see Figure C-J2.7).

(2) For connections such as framing angles and framing tees, which are assumed in the design of the structure to be flexible connections, the tension edges of the outstanding legs or flanges must be left unwelded over a substantial portion of their length to provide flexibility in the connection. Tests have shown that the static strength of the connection is the same with or without end returns; therefore, the use of returns is optional, but if used, their length must be restricted to not more than four times the weld size (Johnston and Green, 1940) (see Figure C-J2.8).

(3) Experience has shown that when ends of intermediate transverse stiffeners on the webs of plate girders are not welded to the flanges (the usual practice), small torsional distortions of the flange occur near shipping bearing points in the normal course of shipping by rail or truck and may cause high out-of-plane bending stresses (up to the yield point) and fatigue cracking at the toe of the web-to-flange welds. This has been observed even with closely fitted stiffeners. The intensity of these out-of-plane stresses may be effectively limited and cracking prevented if "breathing room" is provided by terminating the stiffener weld away from the web-to-flange welds. The unwelded distance should not exceed six times the web thickness so that column buckling of the web within the unwelded length does not occur.

(4) For fillet welds that occur on opposite sides of a common plane, it is difficult to deposit a weld continuously around the corner from one side to the other without causing a gouge in the corner of the parts joined; therefore, the welds must be interrupted at the corner (see Figure C-J2.9). AWS D1.1/D1.1M includes a specific exception that permits continuous welds around opposite sides of a common plane where the engineer requires sealed joints.

### 3. Plug and Slot Welds

A plug weld is a weld made in a circular hole in one member of a joint fusing that member to another member. A slot weld is a weld made in an elongated hole in one member of a joint fusing that member to another member. Both plug and slot welds are only applied to lap joints. Care should be taken when plug or slot welds are applied to structures subjected to cyclic loading as the fatigue performance of these welds is limited.

A fillet weld inside a hole or slot is not a plug weld. A puddle weld, typically used for joining decking to the supporting steel, is not the same as a plug weld.

<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-J2.8. Flexible connection returns optional unless subject to fatigue.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_14.md -->

### 3 a. Effective Area

When plug and slot welds are detailed in accordance with Section J2.3b, the strength of the weld is controlled by the size of the fused area between the weld and the base metal. The total area of the hole or slot is used to determine the effective area.

### 3 b. Limitations

Plug and slot welds are limited to situations where they are loaded in shear or where they are used to prevent elements of a cross section from buckling, such as for web doubler plates on deeper rolled sections. Plug and slot welds are only allowed where the applied loads result in shear between the joined materials—they are not to be used to resist direct tensile loads. This restriction does not apply to fillets in holes or slots.

The geometric limitations on hole and slot sizes are prescribed in order to provide a geometry that is conducive to good fusion. Deep, narrow slots and holes make it difficult for the welder to gain access and see the bottom of the cavity into which weld metal must be placed. Where access is difficult, fusion may be limited and the strength of the connection reduced.

### 4. Strength

The strength of welds is governed by the strength of either the base material or the deposited weld metal. Table J2.5 presents the nominal weld strengths and the  $ \phi $  and  $ \Omega $  factors, as well as the limitations on filler metal strength levels.

The strength of a joint that contains a complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove weld, whether loaded in tension or compression, is dependent upon the strength of the base metal and no computation of the strength of the CJP groove weld is required. For tension applications, matching strength filler metal is required, as defined in AWS D1.1/D1.1M, Table 5.4. For compression applications, up to a 10 ksi (69 MPa) decrease in filler metal strength is permitted, which is equivalent to one strength level.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_19_img_in_image_box_158_849_706_1160.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-J2.9. Details for fillet welds that occur on opposite sides of a common plane.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_15.md -->

CJP groove welds loaded in tension or compression parallel to the weld axis, such as for the groove-welded corners of box columns, do not transfer primary loads across the joint. In cases such as this, no computation of the strength of the CJP groove weld strength is required.

CJP groove-welded tension joints are intended to provide strength equivalent to the base metal; therefore, matching filler metal is required. CJP groove welds have been shown not to exhibit compression failure even when they are undermatched. The amount of undermatching before unacceptable deformation occurs has not been established, but one standard strength level is conservative and therefore permitted. Joints in which the weld strength is calculated based on filler metal classification strength can be designed using any filler metal strength equal to or less than matching. Filler metal selection is still subject to compliance with AWS D1.1/D1.1M.

Connections that contain partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welds designed to bear in accordance with Section J1.4(b), and where the connection is loaded in compression, are not limited in strength by the weld because the surrounding base metal can transfer compression loads. When not designed in accordance with Section J1.4(b), an otherwise similar connection must be designed considering the possibility that either the weld or the base metal may be the critical component in the connection.

The factor of 0.6 on  $ F_{EXX} $  for the tensile strength of PJP groove welds has been used since the early 1960s to compensate for factors such as the notch effect of the unfused area of the joint and uncertain quality in the root of the weld because PJP groove welds are typically not subjected to nondestructive evaluation. It does not imply that the tensile failure mode is by shear stress on the effective throat, as is the case with fillet welds.

The nominal strength of PJP groove-welded joints in compression is higher than for joints in tension or shear because the compression limit states are not observed on weld metal until significantly above the yield strength. Further, as the PJP groove weld deforms, bearing on the unfused surface of the joint eventually occurs and compression loads can be transferred through this interface. Column splices have historically been connected with relatively small PJP groove welds. Compressive stress is not a design consideration for these PJP welds when the connection meets the requirements of Section J1.4(a). These connections are in compression, adequately braced, and designed to bear. Section M4.4 recognizes that, in the as-fitted condition, the contact may not be consistent across the joint and therefore rules are provided to assure some contact that limits the potential deformation of weld metal and the surrounding material. Therefore, the compressive stress in the weld metal does not need to be considered per the requirements of Section J1.4(b). When compression members other than columns are designed to bear per the requirements of Section J1.4(b), the compression stress in the PJP welds may also be neglected. All PJP compression joints should also be proportioned to resist any tension developed by the load combinations stipulated in Section B2 and as may be required in Section J1.4(b).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_16.md -->

In Table J2.5, the nominal strength of fillet welds is determined from the effective throat area, whereas the strengths of the connected parts are governed by their respective thicknesses. Figure C-J2.10 illustrates the shear planes for fillet welds and base material:

(a) Plane 1-1, in which the strength is governed by the shear strength of material A

(b) Plane 2-2, in which the strength is governed by the shear strength of the weld metal

(c) Plane 3-3, in which the strength is governed by the shear strength of material B

The strength of the welded joint is the lowest of the strengths calculated in each plane of shear transfer. Note that planes 1-1 and 3-3 are positioned away from the fusion areas between the weld and the base material. Tests have demonstrated that the stress on this fusion area is not critical in determining the shear strength of fillet welds (Preece, 1968).

The shear planes for plug and PJP groove welds are shown in Figure C-J2.11 for the weld and base metal. Generally, the base metal will govern the shear strength.

The instantaneous center of rotation method is a valid approach to calculate the strength of weld groups consisting of elements oriented in various directions relative to the load. The instantaneous center of rotation method considers strain compatibility among the elements in the weld group. Aspects of the method were previously included in the Specification. These aspects along with a more comprehensive explanation of the method are discussed in the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017).

Welds to HSS are inherently single-sided. Experimental testing and numerical studies have been performed on fillet-welded joints to the ends of HSS members, where the HSS end is connected to a thick, rigid plate and the HSS is subjected to axial tension (Packer et al., 2016; Tousignant and Packer, 2016, 2017b). In such situations, the entire weld length is effective due to the rigid base material. This research has shown that single-sided welds to a tension-loaded HSS wall element are partially unrestrained and are prone to local bending about the axis of the weld, as shown

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_19_img_in_image_box_153_910_708_1170.jpg" ></div>

in Figure C-J2.12, leading to opening of the weld root. The restraint provided to the fillet weld depends on the connected element thickness and shape (linear versus curved), as well as the weld size and amount of penetration. It was found that the HSS welded joints in this research did not achieve the expected target reliability (safety) index of  $ \beta = 4.0 $  (Specification Commentary B3.1) at failure, if the directional strength increase factor,  $ k_{ds} $ , was applied. Thus, this factor of  $ (1.00 + 0.5 \sin^{1.5}\theta) $  should be set to unity (in other words,  $ \theta $  taken as zero) for fillet welds at the ends of rectangular, tension-loaded HSS wall elements. The single-sided weld effect was more severe for square and rectangular HSS than for round HSS. Because recent numerical research (Tousignant and Packer, 2017a) found that round HSS-to-rigid plate connections generated  $ \beta = 3.6 $ , which is only marginally lower than the target of  $ \beta = 4.0 $ , fillet welds to the ends of tension-loaded round HSS have been excluded from the prohibition on the use of the directional strength increase factor.

Use of the directional strength increase factor is not permitted for fillet welds to the ends of square and rectangular HSS in which any face is in tension, when the design approach is to develop the yield strength of the connected HSS wall, nor when the design is a "fit-for-purpose" approach. The latter is covered in Section K5 and entails

the use of weld effective lengths. Those provisions have been shown to generate suitable target reliability (safety) indices for welded joints to square and rectangular HSS with faces in tension, in conjunction with the weld effective lengths advocated and without the directional strength increase factor (McFadden and Packer, 2014; Tousignant and Packer, 2015). Use of the directional strength increase factor is permitted for double-sided fillet welds to longitudinal or transverse plate branches attached to HSS, regardless of branch loading. The fillet weld directional strength increase factor is also permitted for HSS branches to HSS chords, where all of the branch remains in compression.

### 5. Combination of Welds

When determining the strength of a combination PJP groove weld and fillet weld contained within the same joint, the total throat dimension is not the simple addition of the fillet weld throat and the groove weld throat. In such cases, the resultant throat of the combined weld (shortest dimension from the root to face of the final weld) must be determined and the design based upon this dimension.

### 6. Filler Metal Requirements

Applied and residual stresses and geometrical discontinuities from backing bars with associated notch effects contribute to sensitivity to fracture. Additionally, some weld metals in combination with certain procedures result in welds with low notch toughness. Accordingly, this Specification requires a minimum specified toughness for weld metals in those joints that are subjected to more significant applied stresses and toughness demands. The level of toughness required is selected as one level more conservative than the base metal requirement for hot-rolled shapes with a flange thickness exceeding 2 in. (50 mm).

### 7. Mixed Weld Metal

Problems can occur when incompatible weld metals are used in combination and notch-tough composite weld metal is required. For instance, tack welds deposited using a self-shielded process with aluminum deoxidizers in the electrodes and subsequently covered by SAW weld passes can result in a composite weld metal with low notch toughness, despite the fact that each process by itself could provide notch-tough weld metal.

Potential concern about intermixing weld metal types is limited to situations where one of the two weld metals is deposited by the self-shielded flux-cored arc welding (FCAW-s) process. Changes in tensile and elongation properties have been demonstrated to be of insignificant consequence. Notch toughness is the property that can be affected the most. Many compatible combinations of FCAW-s and other processes are commercially available.

### J3. BOLTS, THREADED PARTS, AND BOLTED CONNECTIONS

### 2. High-Strength Bolts

The use of high-strength bolts is required to conform to the provisions of the RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts (RCSC, 2020), hereafter referred to as RCSC Specification, as approved by the Research Council on Structural Connections, except where provisions of that specification differ from this specification. Kulak (2002) provides an overview of the properties and use of high-strength bolts.

Examples of provisions in this Specification that vary from the RCSC Specification are as follows:

(a) This Specification and the RCSC Specification allow bolt grades of ASTM F3125/F3125M Grades A325, A325M, A490, A490M, F1852, F2280, and ASTM F3148. This Specification also permits ASTM F3043, ASTM F3111, ASTM A354 Grade BC, ASTM A354 Grade BD, and ASTM A449 bolts under certain conditions.

(b) This Specification uses a three-line approximation for the available stress of bolts subjected to tension and shear as opposed to an elliptical equation for available strength in the RCSC Specification.

(c) Exceptions to the RCSC Specification associated with cyclically loaded connections are contained in Commentary Appendix 3.

(d) This Specification has provisions for the design of threaded fasteners in hollow structural sections (HSS).

Occasionally the need arises for the use of high-strength bolts of diameters in excess of those permitted for ASTM F3125/F3125M Grades A325, A325M, A490, or A490M bolts (or lengths exceeding those available in these grades). For joints requiring diameters in excess of  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm) or lengths in excess of 12 diameters, Section J3.2 permits the use of ASTM A449 bolts and ASTM A354 Grade BC and BD threaded rods. When ASTM A354 or ASTM A449 bolts are to be pretensioned

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_20.md -->

they must have geometry matching that of ASTM F3125/F3125M Grades A325, A325M, A490, or A490M bolts. The fastener dimensions should be specified as heavy hex structural bolts and the threads specified as Unified Coarse Thread Series with Class 2A tolerances per ASME B18.2.6 (ASME, 2019). The minimum tensile strength of ASTM A449 bolts reduces for bolts greater than 1 in. (25 mm) in diameter and again for bolts greater than 1½ in. (38 mm) in diameter. Therefore, these bolts should be designed as threaded parts in Table J3.2. Note that anchor rods are more preferably specified as ASTM F1554 material. Fasteners made of materials with 150 ksi (1 000 MPa) tensile strength or higher, such as ASTM A354 Grade BD, and pretensioned to near the yield strength may be susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Designers are cautioned to evaluate the effects of galvanizing and of threads rolled after heat treatment. Some exposures can increase susceptibility. ASTM A143/A143M (ASTM, 2020a) includes some information helpful in reducing internal hydrogen embrittlement. External hydrogen embrittlement should also be considered.

High-strength bolts have been grouped by strength levels into four categories:

(1) Group 120 bolts, which have a strength similar to ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A325 or A325M bolts

(2) Group 144 bolts, which have a strength similar to ASTM F3148 Grade 144 assemblies

(3) Group 150 bolts, which have a strength similar to ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A490 or A490M bolts

(4) Group 200 bolts, which have a strength similar to ASTM F3111 bolts

Group 144 bolting assemblies have been added in this edition of the specification to address ASTM F3148. Group 144 bolting assemblies are intended to be used in bearing, pretensioned, or slip-critical connections. These fixed-spline drive bolting assemblies use the combined method of installation, which is similar to the turn of the nut method. When using the combined method, the initial pretension is achieved using torque and confirmed in a preverification test. The initial pretensioned condition also requires that the connected elements are in firm contact. The final pretension is achieved by applying an established angle of relative rotation between the bolt and nut. This final pretensioning step is similar to the turn-of-nut method, but the angle of rotation is different and likely less because it is relative to the initial tension condition of the combined method, which is usually higher than the minimum snug-tight condition required for the turn-of-nut method. Matchmarking of the nut and the protruding end of the bolt after initial tensioning can be helpful in subsequent installation and as an aid to inspection if routine observation is not performed. Bolting assemblies used for the combined method should be treated as matched bolting assemblies. When used in pretensioned or slip-critical connections, the ASTM F3148 pretension requirement, and therefore the resulting slip resistance, compares favorably to that of ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A490 or Grade A490M bolts using the turn-of-nut method. Testing performed by the University of Cincinnati (Roenker, 2017) demonstrated that ASTM F3148 bolting assemblies averaged 1.37 times the specified minimum pretension. Previous studies of ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_21.md -->

A325, A325M, A490, and A490M bolts installed using the turn-of-nut method average 1.35 and 1.26 times the specified minimum pretension, respectively.

The combined method is common for steel construction in Europe, and frequently used in other industries, such as automotive and aerospace. The ASTM F3148 implementation of the combined method closely mirrors the requirements in EN 14399-4 (CEN, 2016), and EN 1090-2 (CEN, 2018).

Group 200 bolting assemblies were added to this Specification in 2016. They are based upon bolting assemblies of 200 ksi (1400 MPa) tensile strength used in building structures in Japan. The bolt steel is produced to minimize risk of internal hydrogen embrittlement, with bolt design features to minimize stress and strain concentrations including increased radius under the bolt head, a shank transition near the threads, and a wider, smoother radius at the thread root. Basic head, shank, and nut dimensions are compatible with installation tools used for Group 120 and Group 150 bolts, as specified in ASME B18.2.6 (ASME, 2019). Group 200 Grade 1 bolting assemblies use an ASME B1.15 UNJ thread root profile and Grade 2 bolting assemblies use a proprietary thread root profile (ASME, 1995).

The use of Group 200 bolts is limited to applications and locations that would not subject the bolting assembly to environmental hydrogen embrittlement. Use is intended for building interiors that are normally dry, including where the structural steel is embedded in concrete, encased in masonry, or protected by membrane or noncorrosive contact type fireproofing, as well as for building interiors and exteriors that are normally dry and under roof with the installed assemblies soundly protected by a shop-applied or field-applied coating to the structural steel system. Use is not intended for the following: (1) structural steel framing not under roof; (2) chemical or heavy industrial environments where strong concentrations of highly corrosive gases, fumes, or chemicals, either in solution or as concentrated liquids or solids, contact the bolting assembly or the structural steel coating system; (3) locations with high humidity environments maintaining almost continuous condensation; (4) locations submerged in water or soil; or (5) cathodically protected environments where current is applied to the structural steel system by the sacrificial anode method or the DC power method.

Group 200 Grade 2 bolts have been subjected to testing to validate the prescribed pretensioning methods and have their thread root profile performance validated by successful performance in numerous projects. Group 200 Grade 1 bolts, as of the date of this standard, have not been subjected to testing to validate the prescribed pretensioning methods and have not been tested to validate that the sharper UNJ thread root profile is adequate for performance in a pretensioned application. Therefore, Grade 2 bolts are permitted to be used in snug-tight, pretensioned, and slip-critical joints, and Grade 1 fasteners are restricted to use in the snug-tight condition.

The Group 200 transition shank cross-sectional area approximates the tensile stress area of the bolt. The tensile stress area of the Grade 2 assembly is approximately 4% greater than that for Grade 1. For simplicity, the nominal shear strength for transition shank or threads included in the shear plane is based upon 80% of the full shank cross-sectional area. Nominal tensile strength is based upon 75% of the specified

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_22.md -->

minimum tensile strength of the bolt. As only Grade 2 is permitted to be pretensioned, the bolt pretension is based upon the Grade 2 tensile stress area.

Snug-tightened installation is the most economical installation procedure and is permitted for bolts in bearing-type connections, except where pretensioning is required in the Specification. Only Group 120 bolts in tension or combined shear and tension, and Group 144 and Group 150 bolts in shear, where loosening or fatigue are not designed considerations, are permitted to be installed snug tight. Two studies have been conducted to investigate possible reductions in strength because of varying levels of pretension in bolts within the same connection. The studies found that no significant loss of strength resulted from having different pretensions in bolts within the same connection, even with ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A490 or A490M bolts. See Commentary Section J3.7 for more details.

There are no specified minimum or maximum pretensions for snug-tight installation of bolting assemblies. The only requirement is that the bolts bring the plies into firm contact. Depending on the thickness of material and the possible distortion due to welding, portions of the connection may not be in contact.

There are practical cases in the design of structures where slip of the connection is desirable to allow for expansion and contraction of a joint in a controlled manner. Regardless of whether force transfer is required in the direction normal to the slip direction, the nuts should be hand-tightened with a spud wrench and then backed off one-quarter turn. Furthermore, it is advisable to deform the bolt threads or use a locking nut or jamb nut so that the nut does not back off further under service conditions. Thread deformation is commonly accomplished with a cold chisel and hammer applied at one location. Note that tack-welding of the nut to the bolt threads is not recommended.

### 3. Size and Use of Holes

Standard holes or short-slotted holes transverse to the direction of load are permitted for all applications complying with the requirements of this Specification. To accommodate manufacturing process tolerances and provide fit and rotation capacity proportional to the size of connections typically using large diameter bolts, the size of standard holes for bolts 1 in. (25 mm) in diameter and larger is increased to  $ \frac{1}{8} $  in. (3 mm) over the bolt diameter. The size of standard holes in S.I. units already provides sufficient tolerance and is not increased. In addition, to provide some latitude for adjustment in plumbing a frame during erection, short-slotted, long-slotted, and oversized holes are permitted, subject to the approval of the engineer of record. The nominal maximum sizes of these holes are given in Table J3.3 or J3.3M. The use of these holes is restricted to connections assembled with high-strength bolts and is subject to the provisions of Sections J3.3 and J3.4.

### 4. Minimum Spacing

The minimum spacing dimension of  $ 2\frac{1}{3} $  times the nominal diameter is to facilitate construction and does not necessarily satisfy the bearing and tearout strength requirements in Section J3.11.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_23.md -->

### 5. Minimum Edge Distance

Prior to the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), separate minimum edge distances were given in Tables J3.4 and J3.4M for sheared edges and for rolled or thermally cut edges. Sections J3.11 and J4 are used to prevent exceeding bearing and tearout limits, are suitable for use with both thermally cut, sawed, and sheared edges, and must be met for all bolt holes. Accordingly, the edge distances in Tables J3.4 and J3.4M are workmanship standards and are no longer dependent on edge condition or fabrication method.

### 6. Maximum Spacing and Edge Distance

Limiting the edge distance to not more than 12 times the thickness of the connected part under consideration, but not more than 6 in. (150 mm), is intended to provide for the exclusion of moisture in the event of paint failure, thus preventing corrosion between the parts that might accumulate and force these parts to separate. More restrictive limitations are required for connected parts of unpainted weathering steel exposed to atmospheric corrosion.

The longitudinal spacing applies only to elements consisting of a shape and a plate, or two plates. For elements, such as back-to-back angles not subject to corrosion, the longitudinal spacing may be as required for structural requirements.

### 7. Tension and Shear Strength of Bolts and Threaded Parts

Tension loading of fasteners is usually accompanied by some bending due to the deformation of the connected parts. Hence, the resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , and the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ , are relatively conservative. The nominal tensile stress values in Table J3.2 were obtained from the equation,

 $$ F_{nt}=0.75F_{u} $$ 

The factor of 0.75 included in this equation accounts for the approximate ratio of the effective tension area of the threaded portion of the bolt to the area of the shank of the bolt for common sizes between  $ \frac{1}{2} $  in. and 2 in., with ratios ranging between 0.72 and 0.80. For metric bolts and threaded rods between M16 and M36, the ratios range between 0.78 and 0.80. Thus,  $ A_{b} $  is defined as the area of the unthreaded body of the bolt, and the value given for  $ F_{nt} $  in Table J3.2 is calculated as  $ 0.75F_{u} $ . For larger bolts and threaded rods, the use of the actual tensile stress area may provide significant increased tensile strength for design purposes in which case,  $ F_{nt} = F_{u} $ .

The tensile stress given by Equation C-J3-1 is independent of whether the bolt was initially installed pretensioned or snug-tightened. Tests confirm that the performance of ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A325 and A325M bolts in tension not subjected to fatigue are unaffected by the original installation condition (Amrine and Swanson, 2004; Johnson, 1996; Murray et al., 1992). While the equation was developed for bolted connections, it was also conservatively applied to threaded parts (Kulak et al., 1987).

Previously, for the withdrawn standards, ASTM A325 and A325M, the specified minimum tensile stress,  $ F_{u} $ , was lower for bolts with diameters in excess of 1 in.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_24.md -->

(25 mm). This difference no longer exists under the ASTM F3125/F3125M standard. This is also reflected in the minimum bolt pretensions provided in Table J3.1.

The values of nominal shear stress in Table J3.2 were obtained from the following equations rounded to the nearest whole ksi (MPa):

(a) When threads are excluded from the shear planes

 $$ F_{nv}=0.563F_{u} $$ 

(b) When threads are not excluded from the shear plane

 $$ F_{nv}=0.45F_{u} $$ 

The factor 0.563 accounts for the effect of a shear/tension ratio of 0.625 and a 0.90 length reduction factor. The factor of 0.45 is 80% of 0.563, which accounts for the reduced area of the threaded portion of the fastener when the threads are not excluded from the shear plane. The initial reduction factor of 0.90 is imposed on connections with lengths up to and including 38 in. (950 mm). The resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , and the safety factor,  $ \Omega $ , for shear in bearing-type connections in combination with the initial 0.90 factor accommodate the effects of differential strain and second-order effects in connections less than or equal to 38 in. (950 mm) in length.

In connections consisting of only a few fasteners and length not exceeding approximately 16 in. (400 mm), the effect of differential strain on the shear in bearing fasteners is negligible (Kulak et al., 1987; Fisher et al., 1978; Tide, 2010). In longer tension and compression joints, the differential strain produces an uneven distribution of load between fasteners, those near the end taking a disproportionate part of the total load, so that the maximum strength per fastener is reduced. This Specification does not limit the length but requires that the initial 0.90 factor be replaced by 0.75 when determining bolt shear strength for end-loaded connections longer than 38 in. (950 mm). In lieu of another column of design values, the appropriate values are obtained by multiplying the tabulated values by 0.75/0.90 = 0.833, as given in the Table J3.2 footnote.

The foregoing discussion is primarily applicable to end-loaded tension and compression connections, but for connection lengths less than or equal to 38 in. (950 mm) it is applied to all connections to maintain simplicity. For shear-type connections used in beams and girders with lengths greater than 38 in. (950 mm), there is no need to make the second reduction. Examples of end-loaded and non-end-loaded connections are shown in Figure C-J3.1.

When determining the shear strength of a fastener, the area,  $ A_{b} $ , is multiplied by the number of shear planes. While developed for bolted connections, the equations were also conservatively applied to threaded parts. The value given for ASTM A307 bolts was obtained from Equation C-J3-3 but is specified for all cases regardless of the position of threads.

Structural fasteners are manufactured to dimensional standards found in ASME B18.2.6 (ASME, 2019) and ASME B18.2.6M (ASME, 2012), wherein the length of the threads is listed as a reference dimension as opposed to a control dimension. As a result, the thread length, which is often considered to be constant for a given bolt

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_25.md -->

size, may actually vary slightly depending on the length of the bolt. As a result, bolts that would have a short, unthreaded shank based on published thread lengths are often manufactured without an unthreaded shank. Bolts in that category are typically the shortest length available for each size and should be designed assuming that the threads are not excluded from the shear plane. Additional information is available in Swanson et al. (2020).

In Table J3.2, footnote d, the specified reduction of 1% for each  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) over 5 diameters for ASTM A307 bolts is a carryover from the reduction that was specified for long rivets. Because the material strengths are similar, it was decided a similar reduction was appropriate.

Additional information regarding the development of the provisions in this section can be found in the Commentary to the RCSC Specification.

### 8. Combined Tension and Shear in Bearing-Type Connections

Tests have shown that the strength of bearing fasteners subjected to combined shear and tension resulting from externally applied forces can be closely defined by an ellipse (Kulak et al., 1987). The relationship is expressed as follows:

For design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD)

 $$ \left(\frac{f_{t}}{\phi F_{n t}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{f_{v}}{\phi F_{n v}}\right)^{2}=1 $$ 

For design according to Section B3.2 (ASD)

 $$ \left(\frac{\Omega f_{t}}{F_{n t}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\Omega f_{v}}{F_{n v}}\right)^{2}=1 $$ 

where

 $$ F_{nt} = \text{nominal tensile stress, ksi (MPa)} $$ 

 $ F_{nv} $  = nominal shear stress, ksi (MPa)

ft = required tensile stress, ksi (MPa)

 $$ f_{v} = required shear stress, ksi (MPa) $$ 

The elliptical relationship can be replaced, with only minor deviations, by three straight lines as shown in Figure C-J3.2. The sloped portion of the straight-line representation follows.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_19_img_in_image_box_168_713_692_1147.jpg" ></div>


 $$ f_{v} $$ 

<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-J3.2. Straight-line representation of elliptical solution.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_27.md -->

For design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD)

 $$ \left(\frac{f_{t}}{\phi F_{nt}}\right)+\left(\frac{f_{v}}{\phi F_{nv}}\right)=1.3 $$ 

For design according to Section B3.2 (ASD)

 $$ \left(\frac{\Omega f_{t}}{F_{n t}}\right)+\left(\frac{\Omega f_{v}}{F_{n v}}\right)=1.3 $$ 

which results in Equations J3-3a and J3-3b (Carter et al., 1997).

This latter representation offers the advantage that no modification of either type of stress is required in the presence of fairly large magnitudes of the other type. Note that Equations J3-3a and J3-3b can be rewritten so as to find the nominal shear strength per unit area,  $ F_{nv}' $ , as a function of the required tensile stress,  $ f_{t} $ . These formulations are as follows:

For design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD)

 $$ F_{nv}^{\prime}=1.3F_{nv}-\frac{F_{nv}}{\phi F_{nt}}f_{t}\leq F_{nv} $$ 

For design according to Section B3.2 (ASD)

 $$ F_{nv}^{\prime}=1.3F_{nv}-\frac{\Omega F_{nv}}{F_{nt}}f_{t}\leq F_{nv} $$ 

The linear relationship was adopted for use in Section J3.8; generally, use of the elliptical relationship shown in Figure C-J3.2 is acceptable. A similar formulation using the elliptical solution follows.

For design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD)

 $$ F_{nv}^{\prime}=F_{nv}\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{f_{t}}{\phi F_{nt}}\right)^{2}} $$ 

For design according to Section B3.2 (ASD)

 $$ F_{nv}^{\prime}=F_{nv}\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\Omega f_{t}}{F_{nt}}\right)^{2}} $$ 

### 9. High-Strength Bolts in Slip-Critical Connections

The design provisions for slip-critical connections have remained substantially the same for many years. The original provisions, using standard holes with  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) clearance, were based on a 10% probability of slip at code loads when tightened by the calibrated wrench method. This was comparable to a design for slip at approximately 1.4 to 1.5 times code loads. Because slip resistance was considered to be a serviceability design issue, this was determined to be an adequate safety factor.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_28.md -->

Per the RCSC Guide to the Design Criteria for Bolted and Riveted Joints (Kulak et al., 1987), the provisions were revised to include oversized and slotted holes (Allan and Fisher, 1968). The revised provisions included a reduction in the allowable strength of 15% for oversized holes, 30% for long slots perpendicular, and 40% for long slots parallel to the direction of the load.

Except for minor changes and adding provisions for LRFD, the design of slip-critical connections was unchanged until the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b) added a higher reliability level for slip-critical connections designed for use where selected by the engineer of record. The reason for this added provision was twofold. First, the use of slip-critical connections with oversize holes had become very popular because of the economy they afforded, especially with large bolted trusses and heavy vertical bracing systems. While the Commentary to the 2014 RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2014) indicated that only the engineer of record can determine if potential slippage at service loads could reduce the ability of the frame to resist factored loads, it did not give any guidance on how to do this. The 2005 AISC Specification provided a procedure to design to resist slip at factored loads if slip at service loads could reduce the ability of the structure to support factored loads.

Second, many of these connection details require large filler plates. There was a question about the need to develop these fills and how to do it. The 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b) stated that as an alternative to developing the filler "the joint shall be designed as slip critical." The RCSC Specification at this time stated, "The joint shall be designed as a slip-critical joint. The slip resistance of the joint shall not be reduced for the presence of fillers or shims." Both Specifications required the joint to be checked as a bearing connection, which normally would require development of large fillers.

The answer to both of these issues was to provide a method for designing a connection with oversized holes to resist slip at the strength level and not require the bearing strength check for the connection. In order to do this, it was necessary to first determine as closely as possible what the slip resistance currently was for oversized holes. Then it was necessary to establish what would be an adequate level of slip resistance to be able to say the connection could resist slip at factored loads.

Three major research projects formed the primary sources for the development of the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010) provisions for slip-critical connections:

(1) Dusicka and Lewis (2012) evaluated slip-critical connections with fills for the Research Council on Structural Connections. The work provides results relevant to all slip-critical connections with fills.

(2) Grondin et al. (2007) is a two-part study that assembles slip resistance data from all known sources and analyzes reliability of slip-critical connections indicated by that data. A structural system configuration—a long-span roof truss—is evaluated to see if slip required more reliability in slip-critical connections.

(3) Borello et al. (2009) conducted 16 large-scale tests of slip-critical connections in both standard and oversized holes, with and without thick fillers.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_19/doc_29.md -->

Deliberations considered in development of the 2010 AISC Specification slip-critical provisions include the following:

Slip Coefficient for Class A Surfaces. Grondin et al. (2007) rigorously evaluated the procedures for past tests on clean mill scale and eliminated a substantial number of them that did not meet the required protocol. The result was a recommended slip coefficient for Class A unpainted clean mill scale surfaces between 0.31 and 0.32.

Research on galvanized surfaces by Donahue et al. (2014) demonstrated that the practice of hand roughening as-galvanized faying surfaces through wire-brushing results in no significant improvement to the performance of galvanized slip-critical connections; therefore, the requirement to roughen as-galvanized surfaces has been eliminated. "As-galvanized" in this context means a hot-dipped galvanized surface with no supplemental treatment or coating applied to the zinc surface. Although this specification has deleted this requirement to hand roughen as-galvanized surfaces, it does not prohibit hand roughening because this has been a requirement for many decades with no known detrimental effects. Power wire brushing has been prohibited by this Specification and by the RCSC Specification and this prohibition still applies.

The previous requirement to hand-wire brush galvanized surfaces is believed to have been intended to remove wax or other coatings that may be applied to galvanized surfaces. It is believed that such coatings are not typically used when structural steel is hot-dip galvanized and therefore the justification for the previous requirement does not exist. Nonqualified coatings should not be applied to unpainted clean mill scale steel surfaces, blast-cleaned steel surfaces, qualified painted surfaces, or hot-dipped galvanized surfaces. If applied, nonqualified coatings must be removed.

Oversized Holes and Loss of Pretension. Borello et al. (2009) confirmed that there is no additional loss of pretension and that connections with oversized holes had similar slip resistance to the control group with standard holes.

Higher Pretension with Turn-of-Nut or Combined Method. The difficulty in knowing in advance what method of pretensioning would be used resulted in leaving the value of  $ D_{u} $  at 1.13 as established for the calibrated wrench method. The Specification does, however, allow the use of a higher  $ D_{u} $  value when approved by the engineer of record.

Shear/Bearing Strength. Borello et al. (2009) verified that connections with oversized holes, regardless of fill size, can develop the available bearing strength when the fill is developed. There was some variation in shear strength with filler size but the maximum reduction for thick fillers was approximately 15% when undeveloped.

Fillers in Slip-Critical Connections. Borello et al. (2009) indicated that filler thickness did not reduce the slip resistance of the connection. Borello et al. (2009) and Dusicka and Lewis (2012) indicated that multiple fillers, as shown in Figure C-J3.3, reduced the slip resistance. It was determined that a factor for the number of fillers should be included in the design equation. A plate welded to the connected member or connection plate is not a filler plate and does not require this reduction factor.

The 2010 AISC Specification provisions for slip-critical connections were based on the following conclusions:

(a) The mean and coefficient of variation in Class A slip-critical connections supports the use of  $ \mu = 0.31 $ , not 0.33 or 0.35. It was expected that the use of  $ \mu = 0.30 $  would achieve more consistent reliability while using the same resistance factors for both slip classes. The value of  $ \mu = 0.30 $  was selected and the resistance and safety factors reflect this value.

(b) A factor,  $ h_{f} $ , to reflect the use of multiple filler plates was added to the equation for nominal slip resistance resulting in

 $$ R_{n}=\upmu D_{u}h_{f}T_{b}n_{s} $$ 

where

$h_{f} = \text{factor for fillers; coefficient to reflect the reduction in slip due to multiple fills}$

(c)  $ D_{u} $  is defined as a parameter derived from statistical analysis to calculate nominal slip resistance from statistical means developed as a function of installation method and specified minimum pretension and the level of slip probability selected.

(d) The surfaces of fills must be prepared to the same or higher slip coefficient as the other faying surfaces in the connection.

(e) The reduction in design slip resistance for oversized and slotted holes is not due to a reduction in tested slip resistance but is a factor used to reflect the consequence of slip. It was continued at the 0.85 level but clearly documented as a factor increasing the slip resistance of the connection.

The Specification also recognizes a special type of slip-resistant connection for use in built-up compression members in Section E6 where pretensioned bolts with Class A or B faying surfaces are required for end connections, but the connection is designed using the bearing strength of the bolts. This is based on the need to prevent relative movement between elements of the compression member at the ends.

Reliability levels for slip resistance in oversized holes and slots parallel to the load given in Table C-J3.1 exceed reliability levels associated with the nominal strength of main members in the Specification when turn-of-nut pretensioning is used. Reliability of slip resistance when other tightening methods are used exceeds previous

levels and is sufficient to prevent slip at load levels where inelastic deformation of the connected parts is expected. Because the effect of slip in standard holes is less than that of slip in oversized holes, the reliability indices permitted for standard holes are lower than those for oversized holes. This increased data on the reliability of these connections allowed the return to a single design level of slip resistance similar to the 2014 RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2014) and previous AISC Specifications.

### 11. Bearing and Tearout Strength at Bolt Holes

Provisions for bearing strength of bolts differ from those for bearing strength of pins as given in Section J7.

Bearing strength values are provided as a measure of the strength of the material upon which a bolt bears, not as a protection to the fastener, which needs no such protection. Accordingly, the same bearing value applies to all joints assembled by bolts, regardless of fastener shear strength or the presence or absence of threads in the bearing area.

Material bearing strength may be limited either by bearing deformation of the hole or by tearout (a bolt-by-bolt block shear rupture) of the material upon which the bolt bears. In earlier editions of the Specification, both limit states were defined by one equation and termed bearing limit states. For the 2016 edition, the limit states were separated to permit clear reference to each of the limits and their corresponding equations. Kim and Yura (1996) and Lewis and Zwerneman (1996) confirmed the bearing strength provisions for the bearing case wherein the nominal bearing strength,  $ R_{n} $ , is equal to  $ CdtF_{u} $  and C is equal to 2.4, 3.0, or 2.0 depending upon hole type and acceptability of hole ovalization at ultimate load, as indicated in Section J3.11. However, this same research indicated the need for different bearing strength provisions when tearout failure would control. Appropriate equations for tearout strength as a function

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_2.md -->

of clear distance,  $ l_{c} $ , are therefore provided and this formulation is consistent with that in the RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2020).

Frank and Yura (1981) demonstrated that hole elongation greater than  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) will generally begin to develop as the bearing force is increased beyond  $ 2.4dtF_{u} $ , especially if it is combined with high tensile stress on the net section, even though rupture does not occur. For a long-slotted hole with the slot perpendicular to the direction of force, the same is true for a bearing force greater than  $ 2.0dtF_{u} $ . For standard, oversized, and short-slotted holes, independent of load direction, or a long-slotted hole with the slot parallel to the direction of force, an upper bound of  $ 3.0dtF_{u} $  is specified, which anticipates hole ovalization, defined as a deformation greater than  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) at maximum strength.

Additionally, to simplify and generalize tearout strength calculations, the provisions are based upon a clear-distance formulation. Provisions prior to 1999 utilized edge distances and bolt spacings measured to hole centerlines with adjustment factors to account for varying hole type and orientation, as well as minimum edge distance requirements. The effective strength of an individual fastener is the lesser of the fastener shear strength per Section J3.7 and the bearing and tearout strength at the bolt hole per Section J3.11. The strength of a bolt group is a function of strain compatibility and is dependent on the relative stiffnesses of the bolts and connected parts. For typical connections, such as those shown in the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017), it is acceptable to calculate the shear, bearing, and tearout limit states for each bolt in the same connected part and sum the lowest value of the bolt shear or the controlling bearing or tearout limit for each bolt to determine the group strength. The intent is that the separate bearing and tearout equations in this Specification be treated in the same way as the combined equations in the 2010 AISC Specification. This ignores the potential for interaction of these limit states in multiple connected parts, but that impact is small enough in common connection details within the range of the connections shown in Part 10 of the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017), to allow the benefit of this practical simplification in design. Nonstandard connections may be more sensitive to this interaction; in that case, a more exact approach may be necessary.

A new limit state, tearout, for connections made using bolts or rods that pass completely through an unstiffened box member or HSS, has been added. It adopts the same nominal strengths used for bolts in standard holes. Though through-bolts do not provide confinement to the joined plies, the shear rupture check for pin-connected members in Section D5.1 predicts greater strength for pins, which also do not provide confinement, than for bolts. Therefore, the more conservative provision has been adopted.

### 13. Wall Strength at Tension Fasteners

With any connection configuration where the fasteners transmit a tensile force to the HSS or box-section wall, a rational analysis must be used to determine the appropriate limit states. These may include a yield-line mechanism in the wall or pull-out through the wall, in addition to applicable limit states for the fasteners subjected to tension.

### J4. AFFECTED ELEMENTS OF MEMBERS AND CONNECTING ELEMENTS

### 1. Strength of Elements in Tension

Both experimental and theoretical analyses have shown that the area effective in resisting tensile loads can be limited by the ability of the stresses to disperse through the element. The dispersion angle is dependent on the element geometry, the level of constraint, and the inelastic deformation capacity (Dowswell, 2013b). Due to the large inelastic deformation capacity of gusset plates and similar elements subjected to tensile loads, the effective width can be calculated with a  $ 45^{\circ} $  dispersion angle.

### 2. Strength of Elements in Shear

Prior to the 2005 AISC Specification, the resistance factor for shear yielding had been 0.90, which was equivalent to a safety factor of 1.67. In the 1989 ASD Specification (AISC, 1989), the allowable shear yielding stress was  $ 0.4F_{y} $ , which was equivalent to a safety factor of 1.5. To make the LRFD approach in the 2005 AISC Specification consistent with prior editions of the ASD Specification, the resistance and safety factors for shear yielding became 1.00 and 1.50, respectively. The resulting increase in LRFD design strength of approximately 10% is justified by the long history of satisfactory performance of ASD use.

### 3. Block Shear Strength

Tests on coped beams indicated that a tearing failure mode (rupture) can occur along the perimeter of the bolt holes as shown in Figure C-J4.1 (Birkemoe and Gilmor, 1978). This block shear mode combines tensile failure on one plane and shear failure on a perpendicular plane. The failure path is defined by the centerlines of the bolt holes. This same condition exists on welded connections at beam copes. The tensile plane is the length of the horizontal portion of the weld and the shear plane runs from the horizontal weld to the bottom of the cope.

The block shear failure mode is not limited to coped ends of beams; other examples are shown in Figures C-J4.1 and C-J4.2. The block shear failure mode must also be checked around the periphery of welded connections.

<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-J4.1. Failure surface for block shear rupture limit state.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_4.md -->

The Specification has adopted a conservative model to predict block shear strength. The mode of failure in coped beam webs and angles is different than that of gusset plates because the shear resistance is present on only one plane, in which case there must be some rotation of the block of material that is providing the total resistance.

Although tensile failure is observed through the net section on the end plane, the distribution of tensile stresses is not always uniform (Ricles and Yura, 1983; Kulak and Grondin, 2001; Hardash and Bjorhovde, 1985). A reduction factor,  $ U_{bs} $ , is included in Equation J4-5 to approximate the nonuniform stress distribution on the tensile plane. The tensile stress distribution is nonuniform in the two row connections in Figure C-J4.2(b) because the rows of bolts nearest the beam end pick up most of the shear load. For conditions not shown in Figure C-J4.2,  $ U_{bs} $  may be taken as  $ (1-e/l) $ , where e/l is the ratio of the eccentricity of the load to the centroid of the resistance divided by the block length. This fits data reported by Kulak and Grondin (2001), Kulak and Grondin (2002), and Yura et al. (1982).

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_20_img_in_image_box_152_449_707_877.jpg" ></div>

Block shear is a rupture or tearing phenomenon, not a yielding limit state. However, gross yielding on the shear plane can occur when tearing on the tensile plane commences if  $ 0.6F_{u}A_{nv} $  exceeds  $ 0.6F_{y}A_{gv} $ . Hence, Equation J4-5 limits the term  $ 0.6F_{u}A_{nv} $  to not greater than  $ 0.6F_{y}A_{gv} $  (Hardash and Bjorhovde, 1985). Equation J4-5 is consistent with the philosophy in Chapter D for tension members where the gross area is used for the limit state of yielding and the net area is used for the limit state of rupture.

### 4. Strength of Elements in Compression

Specification Section E3 for flexural buckling of members was developed for designing main structural members with various cross-sectional shapes and residual stress patterns. Because connection elements have lower residual stresses and higher shape factors than main members, the buckling strength in the inelastic range is higher than predicted by the Specification equations for flexural buckling of members (Dowswell, 2016). To account for this behavior at low slenderness ratios, the nominal stress is taken as the specified minimum yield stress when the slenderness ratio is equal to or less than 25.

For wide gusset plates modeled as an equivalent column, the effective column width is based on the stress dispersion angle. As discussed in Commentary Section J4.1, the dispersion angle is partially dependent on the inelastic deformation capacity, which increases with decreasing plate slenderness (Dowswell, 2013a). In practice, the equivalent column width is generally calculated with a constant  $ 30^{\circ} $  dispersion angle, which was based on the experimental stress trajectories in elastic gusset plates. In this case, the equivalent cross section is known as the Whitmore section (Whitmore, 1952).

Effective lengths,  $ L_{c} = KL $ , have been developed for several common gusset plate geometries. In most cases, the effective length recommendations were calibrated for use with a  $ 30^{\circ} $  dispersion angle; therefore, gusset plates are typically designed using an equivalent cross section defined by the Whitmore criterion. The equivalent column method is discussed further in Appendix C of AISC Design Guide 29, Vertical Bracing Connections—Analysis and Design (Muir and Thornton, 2014).

Because a corner gusset plate is restrained along two edges, it is difficult to establish either L, the laterally unbraced length of the element, or K, the effective length factor. Dowswell (2006) provides guidance for determining K and L based on empirical data. When the gusset is found to be compact, the slenderness ratio can be assumed to be less than or equal to 25.

### 5. Strength of Elements in Flexure

Affected and connecting elements are often short enough and thick enough that flexural effects, if present at all, do not impact the design. When such elements are long enough and thin enough that flexural effects must be considered, the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017) provides guidance relative to several specific conditions. Part 9 of the AISC Manual contains procedures to check the flexural strength of a coped beam. Part 9 also contains a discussion of prying action, which incorporates a weak-axis flexural strength check for framing-angle connections, endplate connections, flanges, and other similar elements. Part 10 contains procedures

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_6.md -->

to determine the flexural strength of plates used in the extended configuration of the single-plate shear connection. For all other conditions, the checks provided in Section F11 can be used.

The available flexural strength of connecting elements in LRFD can be calculated as the minimum of  $ 0.9F_{y}Z_{gross} $  and  $ 0.75F_{u}Z_{net} $ , or in ASD as the minimum of  $ F_{y}Z_{gross}/1.67 $  and  $ F_{u}Z_{net}/2.00 $ . Consequences of large deflections and supported member or plate instability must be considered when these values are used. If deflection is a concern, the factored loads should also be checked against  $ 0.9F_{y}S_{gross} $  for LRFD (Mohr and Murray, 2008).

Section F13.1 contains checks related to the strength reduction for members with bolt holes in the tension flange, which in some instances may be governed by net flexural rupture.

### J5. FILLERS

As noted in Commentary Section J3.9, research reported in Borello et al. (2009) resulted in significant changes in the design of bolted connections with fillers. Starting with the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), bearing connections with fillers over  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm) thick were no longer required to be developed provided the bolts were designed by multiplying the shear strength by a 0.85 factor. A test has shown that fillers welded to resist their proportion of the load will prevent a loss of shear strength in the bolts (Borello et al., 2009).

Filler plates may be used in lap joints of welded connections that splice parts of different thickness, or where there may be an offset in the joint.

### J7. BEARING STRENGTH

In general, the bearing strength design of finished surfaces is governed by the limit state of bearing (local compressive yielding) at nominal loads. The nominal bearing strength of milled contact surfaces exceeds the yield strength because adequate safety is provided by post-yield strength as deformation increases. Tests on pin connections (Johnston, 1939) and rockers (Wilson, 1934) have confirmed this behavior.

### J8. COLUMN BASES AND BEARING ON CONCRETE

The provisions of this section are identical to equivalent provisions in ACI 318 and ACI 318M (ACI, 2019).

### J9. ANCHOR RODS AND EMBEDMENTS

The term “anchor rod” is used for threaded rods embedded in concrete to anchor structural steel. The term “rod” is intended to clearly indicate that these are threaded rods, not structural bolts, and should be designed as threaded parts per Table J3.2 using the material specified in Section A3.4.

Generally, the largest tensile force for which anchor rods must be designed is that produced by bending moment at the column base and augmented by any uplift caused by the overturning tendency of a building under lateral load.

Shear at the base of a column is seldom resisted by bearing of the column base plate against the anchor rods. Even considering the lowest conceivable slip coefficient, the friction due to the vertical load on a column is generally more than sufficient to transfer the shear from the column base to the foundation. The possible exception is at the base of braced frames and moment frames where larger shear forces may require that shear transfer be accomplished by embedding the column base or providing a shear key at the top of the foundation.

The anchor rod hole sizes listed in Tables C-J9.1 and C-J9.1M are recommended to accommodate the variations that are common for setting anchor rods cast in concrete. These larger hole sizes are not detrimental to the integrity of the supported structure when used with proper washers. The slightly conical hole that results from punching operations or thermal cutting is acceptable.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_8.md -->

If plate washers are utilized to resolve horizontal shear, bending in the anchor rod must be considered in the design and the layout of anchor rods must accommodate plate washer clearances. In this case, special attention must be given to weld clearances, accessibility, edge distances on plate washers, and the effect of the tolerances between the anchor rod and the edge of the hole.

It is important that the placement of anchor rods be coordinated with the placement and design of reinforcing steel in the foundations as well as the design and overall size of base plates. It is recommended that the anchorage device at the anchor rod bottom be as small as possible to avoid interference with the reinforcing steel in the foundation. A heavy-hex nut or forged head is adequate to develop the concrete shear cone. See AISC Design Guide 1, Base Plate and Anchor Rod Design (Fisher and Kloiber, 2006), for design of base plates and anchor rods. See also ACI 318 and ACI 318M (ACI, 2019) and ACI 349 (ACI, 2013) for embedment design; and OSHA Safety and Health Regulations for Construction, Standards—29 CFR 1926 Subpart R—Steel Erection (OSHA, 2015) for anchor rod design and construction requirements for erection safety.

### J10. FLANGES AND WEBS WITH CONCENTRATED FORCES

The Specification separates flange and web strength requirements into distinct categories representing different limit states: flange local bending (Section J10.1), web local yielding (Section J10.2), web local crippling (Section J10.3), web sideway buckling (Section J10.4), web compression buckling (Section J10.5), and web panel-zone shear (Section J10.6). These limit state provisions are applied to two distinct types of concentrated forces normal to member flanges:

(a) Single concentrated forces that may be tensile (such as those delivered by tension hangers) or compressive (such as those delivered by bearing plates at beam interior positions, reactions at beam ends, and other bearing connections)

(b) Double concentrated forces, one tensile and one compressive, that form a couple on the same side of the loaded member, such as that delivered to column flanges through welded and bolted moment connections

Flange local bending applies only for tensile forces, web local yielding applies to both tensile and compressive forces, and the remainder of these limit states apply only to compressive forces.

Transverse stiffeners, also called continuity plates, and web doubler plates are only required when the concentrated force exceeds the available strength given for the applicable limit state. It is often more economical to choose a heavier member than to provide such reinforcement (Carter, 1999; Troup, 1999). The demand may be determined as the largest flange force from the various load cases, although the demand may also be taken as the gross area of the attachment delivering the force multiplied by the specified minimum yield strength,  $ F_{y} $ . Stiffeners and doublers, and their attaching welds, are sized for the difference between the demand and the applicable limit state strength. Detailing and other requirements for stiffeners are provided in Sections J10.7 and J10.8; requirements for doublers are provided in Section J10.9.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_9.md -->

The provisions in Section J10 have been developed for use with wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes; with some judgment, they can also be applied to other shapes. The Commentary related to the individual subsections provides further detail relative to testing and assumptions. Some guidance relating the application of these checks to other sections is provided here. When applied to members with multiple webs, such as rectangular hollow structural sections (HSS) and box sections, the strength calculated in this section should be multiplied by the number of webs.

Flange local bending assumes a single concentrated line load applied transverse to the beam web. It is not generally applicable to other shapes or other loading conditions. For instance, point loads, such as those delivered through bolts in tension, are typically addressed using yield-line methods (Dowswell, 2013b). The web local yielding provisions assume that concentrated loads are distributed into the member spread out with a slope of 2.5:1. This model is likely appropriate for conditions beyond rolled wide flanges. For example, it could be used to determine the local yielding strength for C-shapes where the concentrated load is delivered opposite the web. It has also been applied to HSS where k is typically taken as the outside corner radius. If the radius is not known, it can be assumed to be 1.5t, as implied in Section B4.1b(d). If a fillet weld is present at the juncture of the web and the flange, additional distribution of stress through this weld is often assumed. Web local crippling has been applied to HSS members assuming  $ t_{f} $  and  $ t_{w} $  are both equal to the design wall thickness and the depth, d, is equal to the flat dimension of the HSS sidewall. When the radius is not known, it is typically assumed to be 1.5t, leading to a depth of H - 3t. For box sections, d and h can be taken as the clear distance between the flanges. Equations J10-4, J10-5a, and J10-5b assume restraint between the flange and the web, which may not be present when small and/or intermittent welds join the elements of built-up sections. Web sideway buckling is not generally a consideration for typical closed sections like HSS members. Web compression buckling has been applied to HSS members assuming  $ t_{f} $  and  $ t_{w} $  are both equal to the design wall thickness and the depth, d, is equal to the flat dimension of the HSS sidewall. For box sections, h can be taken as the clear distance between the flanges. Equation J10-8 assumes pinned restraints at the ends of the web. The web panel-zone shear equations are applicable to rolled wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes. The equations in Section J10.6 neglect web stability. For deep members with thin webs, stability should not be neglected. See Chapter G and AISC Design Guide 16, Flush and Extended Multiple-Row Moment End-Plate Connections (Murray and Shoemaker, 2002). Additional inelastic shear strength due to flange deformation is recognized in Equations J10-11 and J10-12, which should not be applied to sections other than rolled wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes. Though the Specification only provides explicit equations for rolled wide-flange sections, panel-zone shear is a consideration for other member types, such as HSS and box sections where moment is transferred at a panel zone.

### 1. Flange Local Bending

Where a tensile force is applied through a plate welded across a flange, that flange must be sufficiently rigid to prevent deformation of the flange and the corresponding high stress concentration in the weld in line with the web.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_10.md -->

The effective column flange length for local flange bending is  $ 12t_{f} $  (Graham et al., 1960). Thus, it is assumed that yield lines form in the flange at  $ 6t_{f} $  in each direction from the point of the applied concentrated force. To develop the fixed edge consistent with the assumptions of this model, an additional  $ 4t_{f} $ , and therefore a total of  $ 10t_{f} $ , is required for the full flange-bending strength given by Equation J10-1. In the absence of applicable research, a 50% reduction has been introduced for cases wherein the applied concentrated force is less than  $ 10t_{f} $  from the member end.

The strength given by Equation J10-1 was originally developed for moment connections but also applies to single concentrated forces, such as tension hangers consisting of a plate welded to the bottom flange of a beam and transverse to the beam web. In the original tests, the strength given by Equation J10-1 was intended to provide a lower bound to the force required for weld fracture, which was aggravated by the uneven stress and strain demand on the weld caused by the flange deformation (Graham et al., 1959).

Recent tests on welds with minimum Charpy V-notch (CVN) toughness requirements show that weld fracture is no longer the failure mode when the strength given by Equation J10-1 is exceeded. Rather, it was found that the strength given by Equation J10-1 is consistently less than the force required to separate the flanges in typical column sections by  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) (Hajjar et al., 2003; Prochnow et al., 2000). This amount of flange deformation is on the order of the tolerances in ASTM A6/A6M, and it is believed that if the flange deformation exceeded this level it could be detrimental to other aspects of the performance of the member, such as flange local buckling. Although this deformation could also occur under compressive normal forces, it is customary that flange local bending is checked only for tensile forces (because the original concern was weld fracture). Therefore, it is not required to check flange local bending for compressive forces.

The provision in Section J10.1 is not applicable to moment end-plate and tee-stub type connections. For these connections, see AISC Design Guide 13, Stiffening of Wide-Flange Columns at Moment Connections: Wind and Seismic Applications (Carter, 1999) or the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017).

### 2. Web Local Yielding

The web local yielding provisions, Equations J10-2 and J10-3, apply to both compressive and tensile forces of bearing and moment connections. These provisions are intended to limit the extent of yielding in the web of a member into which a force is being transmitted. The provisions are based on tests on two-sided directly welded girder-to-column connections (cruciform tests) (Sherbourne and Jensen, 1957) and were derived by considering a stress zone that spreads out with a slope of 2:1. Graham et al. (1960) report pull-plate tests and suggest that a 2.5:1 stress gradient is more appropriate. Recent tests confirm that the provisions given by Equations J10-2 and J10-3 are slightly conservative and that the yielding is confined to a length consistent with the slope of 2.5:1 (Hajjar et al., 2003; Prochnow et al., 2000).

### 3. Web Local Crippling

The web local crippling provisions, Equations J10-4 and J10-5, apply only to compressive forces. Originally, the term "web crippling" was used to characterize a phenomenon now called web local yielding, which was then thought to also predict web crippling adequately. The first edition of the AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 1986) was the first AISC Specification to distinguish between web local yielding and web local crippling. Web local crippling was defined as crumpling of the web into buckled waves directly beneath the load, occurring in more slender webs, whereas web local yielding is yielding of that same area, occurring in stockier webs.

Equations J10-4 and J10-5 are based on research reported in Roberts (1981). The increase in Equation J10-5b for  $ l_{b}/d > 0.2 $  was developed after additional testing to better represent the effect of longer bearing lengths at ends of members (Elgaaly and Salkar, 1991). All tests were conducted on bare steel beams without the expected beneficial contributions of any connection or floor attachments. Thus, the resulting provisions are considered conservative for such applications. Kaczinski et al. (1994) reported tests on cellular box beams with slender webs and confirmed that these provisions are appropriate in this type of member as well.

The equations were developed for bearing connections but are also generally applicable to moment connections. Equation J10-5a and J10-5b are intended to be applied to beam ends where the web of the beam end is not supported, for example, at the end of a seated connection. Where beam end connections are accomplished with the use of web connections, Equation J10-4 should be used to calculate the available strength for the limit state of web local crippling. Figure C-J10.1 illustrates examples of appropriate applications of Equations J10-4 and J10-5 when checking web local crippling for various framing conditions.

The web local crippling phenomenon has been observed to occur in the web adjacent to the loaded flange. For this reason, a stiffener (or stiffeners) or a doubler plate extending at least three-quarters of the web depth is needed to eliminate this limit state. The stiffener depth was changed in the 2016 AISC Specification in response to research by Salker et al. (2015).

### 4. Web Sideway Buckling

The web sideway buckling provisions, Equations J10-6 and J10-7, apply only to compressive forces in bearing connections and do not apply to moment connections. The web sideway buckling provisions were developed after observing several unexpected failures in tested beams (Summers and Yura, 1982; Elgaaly, 1983). In those tests, the compression flanges were braced at the concentrated load, the web was subjected to compression from a concentrated load applied to the flange, and the tension flange buckled as shown in Figure C-J10.2.

Web sidesway buckling will not occur in the following cases:

(a) For flanges restrained against rotation (such as when connected to a slab), when

 $$ \frac{h/t_{w}}{L_{b}/b_{f}}>2.3 $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_12.md -->

(b) For flanges not restrained against rotation, when

 $$ \frac{h/t_{w}}{L_{b}/b_{f}}>1.7 $$

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_13.md -->

Web sideway buckling can be prevented by the proper design of lateral bracing or stiffeners at the load point. It is suggested that local bracing at both flanges be designed for 1% of the concentrated force applied at that point. If stiffeners are used, they must extend from the load point through at least one-half the beam or girder depth. In addition, the pair of stiffeners must be designed to carry the full load. If flange rotation is permitted at the loaded flange, neither stiffeners nor doubler plates are effective.

Equations J10-6 and J10-7 address doubly symmetric sections, consistent with the description in the introduction to Section J10, "wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes." Summers and Yura (1982) suggest, "For singly symmetric cross sections in the plane of bending, h should be taken as twice the depth of web in compression."

### 5. Web Compression Buckling

The web compression buckling provision, Equation J10-8, applies only when there are compressive forces on both flanges of a member at the same cross section, such as might occur at the bottom flange of two back-to-back moment connections under gravity loads. Under these conditions, the slenderness of the member web must be limited to avoid the possibility of buckling. Equation J10-8 is applicable to a pair of moment connections and to other pairs of compressive forces applied at both flanges of a member, for which  $ l_{b}/d $  is approximately less than 1, where  $ l_{b} $  is the length of bearing and d is the depth of the member. Figure C-J10.3 illustrates examples of some appropriate and not appropriate applications of Equation J10-8 when checking web compression buckling. When  $ l_{b}/d $  is not small, the member web should be designed as a compression member in accordance with Chapter E. Equation J10-8 is based on the equation for the elastic buckling strength of a simply supported plate subjected to equal and opposite concentrated forces. The coefficient, 24, has been adjusted downward to reflect the lower bound of test results (Newlin and Chen, 1971).

Where the flanges are not restrained against translation [for example, see Figure C-J10.3(c)], Section J10.5 is not applicable. In such cases, the buckling mode interaction between the member delivering the force and the supporting member needs to be considered by the engineer of record. Refer to Chapter C and Appendix 6 for additional information.

Equation J10-8 is predicated on an interior member loading condition. In the absence of applicable research, a 50% reduction has been introduced for cases wherein the compressive forces are close to the member end.

### 6. Web Panel-Zone Shear

This section addresses panel-zone behavior of wide-flange sections and similar built-up shapes. Panel-zone shear can also occur in other members, such as HSS and box sections and deep and tapered built-up shapes. For these general conditions, the shear strength should be determined in accordance with Chapter G.

Column web shear stresses may be significant within the boundaries of the rigid connection of two or more members with their webs in a common plane. Such webs must be reinforced when the required force,  $ \Sigma R_{u} $  for LRFD or  $ \Sigma R_{a} $  for ASD, along plane A-A in Figure C-J10.4 exceeds the column web available strength,  $ \phi R_{n} $  or  $ R_{n}/\Omega $ , respectively.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_14.md -->

For design according to Section B3.1 (LRFD)

 $$ \Sigma F_{u}=\frac{M_{u1}}{d_{m1}}+\frac{M_{u2}}{d_{m2}}-V_{u} $$ 

where

 $$ M_{u1}\qquad=M_{u1L}+M_{u1G} $$ 

= sum of the moments due to the factored lateral loads,  $ M_{u1L} $ , and the moments due to factored gravity loads,  $ M_{u1G} $ , on the windward side of the connection, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $$ M_{u2}\qquad=M_{u2L}-M_{u2G} $$ 

= difference between the moments due to the factored lateral loads,  $ M_{u2L} $ , and the moments due to factored gravity loads,  $ M_{u2G} $ , on the leeward side of the connection, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $ d_{m1}, d_{m2} = $  distance between flange forces in the moment connection, in. (mm)

For design according to Section B3.2 (ASD)

 $$ \Sigma F_{a}=\frac{M_{a1}}{d_{m1}}+\frac{M_{a2}}{d_{m2}}-V_{a} $$ 

where

 $$ M_{a1}=M_{a1L}+M_{a1G} $$ 

= sum of the moments due to the nominal lateral loads,  $ M_{a1L} $ , and the moments due to nominal gravity loads,  $ M_{a1G} $ , on the windward side of the connection, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $$ M_{a2}=M_{a2L}-M_{a2G} $$ 

= difference between the moments due to the nominal lateral loads,  $ M_{a2L} $ , and the moments due to nominal gravity loads,  $ M_{a2G} $ , on the leeward side of the connection, kip-in. (N-mm)

Historically (and conservatively), 0.95 times the beam depth has been used for  $ d_{m} $ .

If, for LRFD,  $ \Sigma F_{u} \leq \phi R_{n} $ , or for ASD,  $ \Sigma F_{a} \leq R_{n} / \Omega $ , no reinforcement is necessary; in other words,  $ t_{req} \leq t_{w} $ , where  $ t_{w} $  is the column web thickness.

Equations J10-9 and J10-10 limit panel-zone behavior to the elastic range. While such connection panels possess large reserve capacity beyond initial general shear yielding, the corresponding inelastic joint deformations may adversely affect the strength and stability of the frame or story (Fielding and Huang, 1971; Fielding and Chen, 1973). Panel-zone shear yielding affects the overall frame stiffness and, therefore, the resulting second-order effects may be significant. The shear and axial load interaction expression of Equation J10-10, as shown in Figure C-J10.5, provides elastic panel behavior.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_20_img_in_image_box_178_836_684_1180.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_16.md -->

If adequate connection ductility is provided and the frame analysis considers the inelastic panel-zone deformations, the additional inelastic shear strength is recognized in Equations J10-11 and J10-12 by the factor

 $$ \left(1+\frac{3b_{cf}t_{cf}^{2}}{d_{b}d_{c}t_{w}}\right) $$ 

This increase in shear strength due to inelasticity has been most often utilized for the design of frames in high-seismic applications and should be used when the panel zone is designed to develop the strength of the members from which it is formed.

The shear and axial interaction expression incorporated in Equation J10-12, as shown in Figure C-J10.6, recognizes that when the panel-zone web has completely yielded in shear, the axial column load is resisted by the flanges.

### 7. Unframed Ends of Beams and Girders

Full-depth stiffeners are required at unframed ends of beams and girders not otherwise restrained to avoid twisting about their longitudinal axes. These stiffeners are full depth but not fitted. They connect to the restrained flange but do not need to continue beyond the toe of the fillet at the far flange unless connection to the far flange is necessary for other purposes, such as resisting compression from a concentrated load on the far flange.

### 8. Additional Stiffener Requirements for Concentrated Forces

For guidelines on column stiffener design, see Carter (1999), Troup (1999), and Murray and Sumner (2004).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_17.md -->

For rotary-straightened W-shapes, an area of reduced notch toughness is sometimes found in a limited region of the web immediately adjacent to the flange, referred to as the “k-area,” as illustrated in Figure C-J10.7 (Kaufmann et al., 2001). The k-area is defined as the region of the web that extends from the tangent point of the web and the flange-web fillet (AISC k-dimension) a distance  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm) into the web beyond the k-dimension. Following the 1994 Northridge earthquake, there was a tendency to specify thicker transverse stiffeners that were groove-welded to the web and flange, and thicker doubler plates that were often groove-welded in the gap between the doubler plate and the flanges. These welds were highly restrained and may have caused cracking during fabrication in some cases (Tide, 2000). AISC (1997b) recommended that the welds for continuity plates terminate away from the k-area.

Pull-plate tests (Dexter and Melendrez, 2000; Prochnow et al., 2000; Hajjar et al., 2003) and full-scale beam-column joint testing (Bjorhovde et al., 1999; Dexter et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002a) have shown that this problem can be avoided if the column stiffeners are fillet welded to both the web and the flange, the corner is clipped at least  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm), and the fillet welds are stopped short by a weld leg length from the edges of the cutout, as shown in Figure C-J10.8. These tests also show that groove welding the stiffeners to the flanges or the web is unnecessary, and that the fillet welds performed well with no problems. If there is concern regarding the development of the stiffeners using fillet welds, the corner clip can be made so that the dimension along the flange is  $ \frac{3}{4} $  in. (19 mm) and the dimension along the web is  $ 1\frac{1}{2} $  in. (38 mm).

Tests have also shown the viability of fillet welding doubler plates to the flanges, as shown in Figure C-J10.9 (Prochnow et al., 2000; Dexter et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002a; Hajjar et al., 2003). It was found that it is not necessary to groove weld the doubler plates and that they do not need to be in contact with the column web to be fully effective.

### 9. Additional Doubler Plate Requirements for Concentrated Forces

When required, doubler plates are to be designed using the appropriate limit state requirements for the type of loading. The sum of the strengths of the member element and the doubler plate(s) must exceed the required strength, and the doubler plate must be welded to the member element.

### 10. Transverse Forces on Plate Elements

Designing connections to resist forces transverse to the plane of plate elements as shown in Figure C-J10.10 is often not the best solution but where it is required, there must be sufficient flexure and shear strength. This section addresses only strength. Stiffness may also be a consideration; in particular, for moment connections, Section B3.4b must be satisfied. Simple beam connections are required to provide for rotational ductility and usually do not need to have transverse plate elements designed for flexure.

# CHAPTER K

# ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HSS AND BOX-SECTION CONNECTIONS

Chapter K includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Section K1.2 now includes separate equations for the local yielding and punching shear effective widths.

(2) Equations for the chord stress interaction parameter have been revised and collected in Section K1.3.

(3) Additional limit states for rectangular HSS moment connections have been added to Table K4.2.

(4) In Table K4.2, the maximum stress in the sidewall for cross-connections due to in-plane moment is limited to  $ 0.8F_{y} $ .

Chapter K addresses the strength of connections to hollow structural sections (HSS) and box sections of uniform wall thickness, where seam welds between box-section elements are complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove welds in the connection region. The provisions are based on failure modes that have been reported in international research on HSS, much of which has been sponsored and synthesized by CIDECT (International Committee for the Development and Study of Tubular Construction) since the 1960s. This work has also received critical review by the International Institute of Welding (IIW) Subcommission XV-E on "Tubular Structures." The HSS connection design recommendations are generally in accord with the design recommendations by this Subcommission (IIW, 1989). Some minor modifications to the IIW recommended provisions for some limit states have been made by the adoption of the formulations for the same limit states elsewhere in this Specification. These IIW connection design recommendations have also been implemented and supplemented in later design guides by CIDECT (Wardenier et al., 1991; Packer et al., 1992), in the design guide by the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction (Packer and Henderson, 1997), and in CEN (2005a). Parts of these IIW design recommendations are also incorporated in AWS D1.1/D1.1M, Structural Welding Code—Steel (2020). A large amount of research data generated by CIDECT research programs up to the mid-1980s is summarized in CIDECT Monograph No. 6 (Giddings and Wardenier, 1986). Further information on CIDECT publications and reports can be obtained from their website: www.cidect.com.

Chapter K does not prohibit using joints that fall outside the listed limits of applicability; however, this Specification and Commentary do not provide connection capacities or guidance when doing so. A rational approach to their design is left to the designer. This Commentary gives some insight into the failure modes that should be considered. However, some of the discussions presented later concerning which limit states need to be checked, which can be eliminated, and when they can be eliminated, may or may not apply when outside the limits of applicability. There is also one notable failure mode (local buckling of

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_22.md -->

the chord face) that has been eliminated from consideration in both the Specification and Commentary due to the fact that, in tests, it did not control the connection strength when staying within the limits. All potential failure modes should be investigated by the designer when working outside the limits of applicability listed in Chapter K.

When inelastic finite element analysis is used, peak strains in the thick shell  $ (T \times T \times T) $  elements should not exceed 0.02/T at the nominal capacity, where T is the thickness in inches.

The connection capacities calculated in Chapter K are based on strength limit states only. There is no connection deformation limit state considered in these provisions. Sub-commission XV-E of IIW, in their most recent design recommendations (IIW, 2012), have now adopted a limit of 0.03D for round HSS, where D is the HSS diameter, and 0.03B for rectangular HSS, where B is the HSS chord width, as the maximum acceptable connection displacement, perpendicular to the main member face at the ultimate load capacity. This limit state equates to approximately 1% of connection deformation at service loads.

While the majority of Chapter K is in agreement with the previous IIW design recommendations (IIW, 1989), it was determined that adopting a connection deformation limit state for HSS would not be consistent with this Specification, which does not include deformation limit states for connections; however, designers should be aware of the potential for relatively large connection deformations in certain HSS joint configurations. In order to meet the new deformation limit state, IIW and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have made some modifications to the range of validity of T, Y, X, and K gap connections and to the calculations of connection strengths, including changes to the strength reduction based on the chord or main member stress function,  $ Q_{f} $ . The change in the chord stress function is particularly noticeable in high tension areas of main members where no chord stress reduction is necessary when using strength checks only.  $ Q_{f} $  currently is 1.0 for main members in tension. Where connection deformations would be a concern due to serviceability or stability, the IIW (2012) or CIDECT (Wardenier et al., 2008; Packer et al., 2009) recommendations could be used.

The scopes of Sections K2 and K3 note that the centerlines of the branch member(s) and the chord members must lie in a single plane. For other configurations, such as multi-planar connections, connections with partially or fully flattened branch member ends, double-chord connections, connections with a branch member that is offset so that its centerline does not intersect with the centerline of the chord, or connections with round branch members joined to a square or rectangular chord member, the provisions of IIW (1989), CIDECT (Wardenier et al., 1991; Packer et al., 1992), CISC (Packer and Henderson, 1997; Marshall, 1992; AWS, 2015), or other verified design guidance or tests can be used.

To be consistent with the requirements of Chapter K, box-section members require CJP groove seam welds in the connection region so that each of the member's faces acts as a single element and is able to develop the full capacity of that element for all viable failure modes depending on the type of connection, geometric parameters, and loading. This constraint guarantees that box-section connections behave in a manner similar to HSS member connections with the same applicable failure modes. The length of the connection region along each member is determined based on the maximum extent of influence of all possible failure modes for the connection. These failure modes are described by Wardenier (1982) for both rectangular HSS truss connections and rectangular HSS moment connections.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_23.md -->

conservative distance equal to the width of the member away from the face of the intersecting member in the connection can be used to define the connection region.

A 50% reduction is applied to the available strength where the connection occurs at a distance less than  $ l_{end} $  from an unreinforced end of the chord. Cap plates attached to the ends of round and rectangular HSS members contribute to stiffening the end of the member. If a cap plate is sufficiently welded on all sides, a transverse load applied near the end of the member can be conservatively treated as if it were applied to a continuous member with load applied far from the end of the member. Therefore, there is no minimum end distance requirement in the case of a cap plate. The cap plate will allow the HSS member to develop either the strength of the connected face (plastification or shear yielding) or the strength of the sidewalls (yielding or crippling).

### K1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND PARAMETERS FOR HSS CONNECTIONS

The classification of HSS truss-type connections as K- (which includes N-), Y- (which includes T-), or cross- (also known as X-) connections is based on the method of force transfer in the connection, not on the physical appearance of the connection. Examples of such classification are shown in Figure C-K1.1 and identified in the circles with percentages of load carried.

When branch members transmit part of their load as K-connections and part of their load as T-, Y-, or cross-connections, the adequacy of each branch is determined by linear interaction of the proportion of the branch load involved in each type of load transfer. One K-connection, shown in Figure C-K1.1(b), illustrates that the branch force components normal to the chord member may differ by as much as 20% and still be deemed to exhibit K-connection behavior. This is to accommodate slight variations in branch member forces along a typical truss, caused by a series of panel-point loads. The N-connection in Figure C-K1.1(c), however, has a ratio of branch force components normal to the chord member of 2:1. In this case, the connection is analyzed as both a "pure" K-connection (with balanced branch forces) and a cross-connection (because the remainder of the diagonal branch load is being transferred through the connection), as shown in Figure C-K1.2. For the diagonal tension branch in that connection, the following check is also made:

 $$ \begin{aligned}\left(0.5P_{r}\sin\theta/K-connection available strength\right)\\+\left(0.5P_{r}\sin\theta/cross-connection available strength\right)\leq1.0\end{aligned} $$ 

### 2. Rectangular HSS

Due primarily to the flexibility of the connecting face of the chord, the full width of a branch or transverse plate may not be effective. The resulting uneven load distribution is manifested by local buckling of a compression branch or premature yield failure of a tension branch. For T-, Y-, and cross-connections, the two walls of the HSS branch transverse to the chord may only be partially effective, whereas for gapped K-connections only one wall of the branch transverse to the chord is likely to be partially effective, because the HSS chord will be “reinforced” by the equal and opposite force from the other member. This is reflected in the equations for gapped

K-connections. The effective width parameter has been derived from research on transverse plate-to-HSS connections (Davies and Packer, 1982), and the coefficient of 10 in the calculation of the effective width,  $ B_{e} $  and  $ B_{ep} $ , includes a partial safety factor reduction of 1.125 to address the sudden nature of the failure that can occur in some cases (Wardenier et al., 1981).

Uneven load distributions occur for other conditions as well. The flange local bending check, addressed in Section J10.1, was originally intended so that the flange is thick enough to limit the unevenness of the stress to prevent weld fracture. Sections that are not sufficiently thick are reinforced. Generally, it is not practical to reinforce HSS members, so this option is not addressed in the Specification. Figure C-K1.3 illustrates the uneven load concept.

Section J4 addresses the strength of affected elements in tension, compression, flexure, and shear. When performing these checks for connections that deliver transverse load to rectangular HSS, the uneven load distribution described above can generally be accounted for relative to the branch member as shown in Table C-K1.1. The equation for  $ B_{e} $ , the effective width for transverse plates and the transverse elements of

rectangular HSS branches, is empirically derived (Rolloos, 1969; Wardenier et al., 1981; Davies and Packer, 1982).

For simplicity, the punching shear equations for the in-plane and out-of-plane moment conditions conservatively neglect the effective width,  $ B_{e} $ . When the brace is beveled relative to the chord, the punching shear strengths can be adjusted to be consistent with the actual geometry.

When the branch (plate or HSS) width exceeds 85% of the connecting chord width, the transverse force from the branch can be assumed to be transferred predominantly from the branch to the sidewalls of the chord. In such cases, the limit states associated with concentrated forces on the webs of I-sections, web local yielding (Section J10.2), web local crippling (Section J10.3), and web compression buckling (Section J10.5) can be used to determine the strength of the sidewalls of the chord.

When the branch (plate or HSS) width is less than 85% of the connecting chord width, the transverse force from the branch must pass through the face of the chord to be delivered to the sidewalls. Bending and shear on the chord face must be checked.

An analytical yield-line solution for flexure of the connecting chord face serves to limit connection deformations and is known to be well below the ultimate connection strength. A resistance factor,  $ \phi $ , of 1.00 or a safety factor,  $ \Omega $ , of 1.50 is thus appropriate. When the branch width exceeds 85% of the chord width, a yield-line failure mechanism will result in a noncritical connection capacity.

Punching shear can be based on the effective punching shear perimeter around the branch considering the effective width from Section K1.2 with the total branch perimeter being an upper limit on this length.

### 3. Chord-Stress Interaction Parameter

 $ Q_{f} $ , the chord-stress interaction parameter, is provided in Section K1.3 as it is a general parameter that applies to various connection configurations. Previous interaction equations for rectangular HSS main members (chords) could result in a chord-stress interaction parameter less than zero for some extreme conditions. A lower limit of 0.4 is imposed on the calculation to prevent such results in practice. This value is derived by assuming full utilization of the chord in Equation K1-3, which is believed to provide conservative results for both rectangular and round HSS configurations. The equations for  $ Q_{f} $  are based on empirical results and will produce lower values for HSS-to-HSS connections with small width ratios,  $ \beta $ , than for longitudinal plate, with width ratios that are essentially zero. There is no theoretical model that explains these results. The discrepancy is likely the result of inconsistent consideration of factors other than connection strength in the empirical equations by various researchers and organizations.

The user of this Specification is advised that the use of HSS-to-HSS connections with small width ratios results in low strengths and inefficient designs. The stiffness of such connections will also tend to be quite low and may result in unserviceable performance even when sufficient strength exists.

### 4. End Distance

Connection available strengths in Chapters J and K assume a main member with sufficient end distances,  $ l_{end} $ , on both sides of the connection. Equations in Section K1.4 provide limits to how close a branch or plate can be connected to the end of the chord. When a branch or plate is connected near to the end of a chord, there is not enough length to develop the typically assumed yield line patterns. A modified yield line pattern can be shown to develop an equal strength if the branch or plate is at least a distance equal to the minimum end distance,  $ l_{end} $ , from the chord end. Where the end distance is less than the limit, a cap plate or a reduction in the resistance are commonly accepted alternatives. The reduction in resistance may not be a linear proportion of the end distance. When the branch or plate is closer to the unreinforced end of a chord than indicated, the strengths predicted can conservatively be reduced by 50%. The branch member or plate supplying the load must have sufficient lateral restraint. Consideration of the minimum end distance,  $ l_{end} $ , has been added to the Specification in accordance with recent studies (Bu and Packer, 2019).

### K2. CONCENTRATED FORCES ON HSS

Sections K2.2 and K2.3, although pertaining to all concentrated forces on HSS, are particularly oriented towards plate-to-HSS welded connections.

Wide-flange beam-to-HSS partially restrained moment connections can be modeled as a pair of transverse plates at the beam flanges, neglecting the effect of the web. The beam moment is thus produced by a force couple in the beam flanges. The connection flexural strength is then given by the plate-to-HSS connection strength multiplied by the distance between the beam flange centers.

### 1. Definitions of Parameters

Some of the notation used in Chapter K is illustrated in Figure C-K2.1.

### 2. Round HSS

The limits of applicability in Table K2.1A stem primarily from limitations on tests conducted to date.

### 3. Rectangular HSS

When connecting single-plate shear connections to HSS columns, the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017) includes recommendations based on Sherman and Ales (1991) and Sherman (1995b, 1996), where a large number of simple framing connections between wide-flange beams and rectangular HSS columns are investigated, in which the load transferred was predominantly shear. A review of costs also showed that single-plate and single-angle connections were the most economical, with double-angle and fillet-welded tee connections being more expensive. Through-plate and flare-bevel welded tee connections were among the most expensive (Sherman, 1995b). Over a wide range of connections tested, only one limit state was identified for the rectangular HSS column: punching shear failure related to end rotation of the beam, when a thick shear plate was joined to a relatively thin-walled HSS. Prior to 2016, the available shear strength of the HSS wall was compared to the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_20/doc_29.md -->

available tensile strength of the plate. Because the check only applied to single-plate shear connections, it was removed from the Specification. A check was added to the AISC Manual that investigates punching shear of the HSS wall due to a beam end reaction applied eccentrically, with the eccentricity being the distance from the HSS wall to the center-of-gravity of the bolt group.

The strength of a square or rectangular HSS wall with load transferred through a cap plate (or the flange of a T-stub), as shown in Figure C-K2.2, can be calculated by considering the limit states of local yielding and local crippling. In general, the rectangular HSS could have dimensions of  $ B \times H $ , but the illustration shows the bearing length (or width), b, oriented for lateral load dispersion into the wall of dimension B. A conservative distribution slope can be assumed as 2.5:1 from each face of the tee web (Wardenier et al., 1991; Kitipornchai and Traves, 1989), which produces a dispersed load width of  $ (5t_{p} + b) $  relative to local yielding. If this is less than B, only the two sidewalls of dimension B are effective in resisting the load, and even they will both be only partially effective. If  $ (5t_{p} + b) \geq B $ , all four walls of the rectangular HSS will be engaged, and all will be fully effective; however, the cap plate (or T-stub flange) must be sufficiently thick for this to happen. If the weld leg size is known, it is acceptable to assume load dispersion from the toes of the welds. Neglecting the effect of the weld is conservative. The same load dispersion model as shown in Figure C-K2.2 can also be applied to round HSS-to-cap plate connections.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_0.md -->

If a longitudinal plate-to-rectangular HSS connection is made by passing the plate through a slot in the HSS and then welding the plate to both the front and back HSS faces to form a "through-plate connection," the nominal strength can be taken as equal to the sum of the yield-line strength of each wall (Kosteski and Packer, 2003).

### K3. HSS-TO-HSS TRUSS CONNECTIONS

A  $ 30^{\circ} $  minimum branch angle is a practical limit for good fabrication. Smaller branch angles are possible, but prior agreement with the fabricator should be made.

The limits of applicability in Table K3.1A and Table K3.2A generally represent the parameter range over which the equations have been verified through experiments. The following limitations bear explanation.

The restriction on the minimum overlap is applied so that there is an adequate interconnection of the branches to enable effective shear transfer from one branch to the other.

If the gap size in a gapped K- (or N-) connection as shown in Figure C-K1.1(a) becomes large and exceeds the value permitted by the eccentricity limit, the K-connection should be treated as two independent Y-connections. In cross-connections, such as Figure C-K1.1(e), where the branches are close together or overlapping, the combined "footprint" of the two branches can be taken as the loaded area on the chord member. In K-connections, such as Figure C-K1.1(d), where a branch has very little or no loading, the connection can be treated as a Y-connection, as shown.

The design of welded HSS connections is based on potential limit states that may arise for particular connection geometry and loading, which in turn, represent possible failure modes that may occur within prescribed limits of applicability. Some typical failure modes for truss-type connections, shown for rectangular HSS, are given in Figure C-K3.1.

(b) Analysis using web members pin-connected to continuous chord members, as shown in Figure C-K3.2.

### 2. Round HSS

The wall slenderness limit for the compression branch is a restriction so that connection strength is not reduced by branch local buckling.

The minimum width ratio limit for gapped K-connections is based on Packer (2004), who showed that for width ratios less than 0.4, Equation K3-4 may be potentially unconservative when evaluated against proposed equations for the design of such connections by the American Petroleum Institute (API, 1993).

The restriction on the minimum gap size is stated so that adequate space is available to enable welding at the toes of the branches to be satisfactorily performed. The minimum gap limit is intended to restrict the development of excessive load concentration and reflects the limits of testing.

The restriction on the minimum overlap is applied so that there is an adequate interconnection of the branches to enable effective shear transfer from one branch to the other.

The provisions given in Table K3.1 for T-, Y-, cross-, and K-connections are generally based, with the exception of the punching shear provision, on semi-empirical "characteristic strength" expressions that have a confidence of 95%, taking into account the variation in experimental test results as well as typical variations in mechanical and geometric properties. These "characteristic strength" expressions are then multiplied by resistance factors for LRFD or divided by safety factors for ASD to further allow for the relevant failure mode.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_21_img_in_image_box_215_746_646_1094.jpg" ></div>

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_3.md -->

In the case of the chord plastification failure mode,  $ \phi = 0.90 $  and  $ \Omega = 1.67 $ , whereas in the case of punching shear,  $ \phi = 0.95 $  and  $ \Omega = 1.58 $ . For the case of punching shear,  $ \phi = 1.00 $  (equivalent to  $ \Omega = 1.50 $ ) is used in many recommendations or specifications, for example, IIW (1989), Wardenier et al. (1991), and Packer and Henderson (1997), to reflect the large degree of reserve strength beyond the analytical nominal strength expression, which is itself based on the shear yield (rather than ultimate) strength of the material. In this Specification, however,  $ \phi = 0.95 $  and  $ \Omega = 1.58 $  are used to maintain consistency with the factors for similar failure modes in Table K3.2.

If the tensile strength,  $ F_{u} $ , were adopted as a basis for a punching shear rupture criterion, the accompanying  $ \phi $  would be 0.75 and  $ \Omega $  would be 2.00, as elsewhere in this Specification. Then,  $ 0.75(0.6F_{u}) = 0.45F_{u} $  would yield a very similar value to  $ 0.95(0.6F_{y}) = 0.57F_{y} $ , and in fact, the latter is even more conservative for HSS with specified nominal  $ F_{y}/F_{u} $  ratios less than 0.79. Equation K3-1 need not be checked when  $ D_{b} > (D - 2t) $  because this is the physical limit at which the branch can punch into (or out of) the main tubular member.

With round HSS in axially loaded K-connections, the size of the compression branch dominates the determination of the connection strength. Hence, the term  $ D_{b\ comp} $  in Equation K3-4 pertains only to the compression branch and is not an average of the two branches. Thus, if one requires the connection strength expressed as a force in the tension branch, one can resolve the answer from Equation K3-4 into the direction of the tension branch, using Equation K3-5. That is, it is not necessary to repeat a calculation similar to Equation K3-4 with  $ D_{b} $  as the tension branch.

### 3. Rectangular HSS

The restriction on the minimum gap ratio in Table K3.2A is modified from IIW (1989), according to Packer and Henderson (1997), to be more practical. The minimum gap size, g, is only specified so that adequate space is available to enable welding at the toes of the branches to be satisfactorily performed. The minimum gap limit is intended to restrict the development of excessive load concentration and reflects the limits of testing.

The limit state of punching shear, evident in Equation K3-8, is based on the effective punching shear perimeter around the branch, with the total branch perimeter being an upper limit on this length. The term  $ \beta_{eop} $  in Equation K3-8 represents the chord face effective punching shear width ratio adjacent to one of the branch walls transverse to the chord axis. This  $ \beta_{eop} $  term incorporates  $ \phi = 0.80 $  or  $ \Omega = 1.88 $ . Applying to generally one dimension of the rectangular branch footprint, this was deemed to be similar to a global  $ \phi = 0.95 $  or  $ \Omega = 1.58 $  for the whole expression; therefore, this expression for punching shear appears in AWS (2015) with an overall  $ \phi = 0.95 $ . This  $ \phi = 0.95 $  or  $ \Omega = 1.58 $  has been carried over to this Specification, and this topic is discussed further in Commentary Section K3.2. The limitation specified for Equation K3-8 in Table K3.2 indicates when this failure mode is either physically impossible or noncritical. In particular, note that shear yielding is noncritical for square HSS branches.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_4.md -->

For axially loaded, gapped K-connections, plastification of the chord connecting face under the "push-pull" action of the branches is by far the most prevalent and critical failure mode. Indeed, if all the HSS members are square, this failure mode is critical and Equation K3-7 is the only one to be checked. This formula for chord face plastification is a semi-empirical "characteristic strength" expression, which has a confidence of 95%, taking into account the variation in experimental test results as well as typical variations in mechanical and geometric properties. Equation K3-7 is then multiplied by a  $ \phi $  factor for LRFD or divided by an  $ \Omega $  factor for ASD, to further allow for the failure mode and provide an appropriate safety margin. A reliability calibration (Packer et al., 1984) for this equation, using a database of 263 gapped K-connections and the exponential expression for the resistance factor (with a reliability index of 3.0 and a coefficient of variation of 0.55) derived a  $ \phi = 0.89 $  and a corresponding  $ \Omega = 1.69 $ , while also imposing the parameter limits of validity. Because this failure mode dominates the test database, there is insufficient supporting test data to calibrate Equations K3-8 and K3-9.

For the limit state of shear yielding of the chord in the gap of gapped K-connections, Table K3.2 differs from international practice (IIW, 1989) by recommending application of another section of this Specification—Section G4. This limit state need only be checked if the chord member is rectangular, not square, and is also oriented such that the shorter wall of the chord section lies in the plane of the truss, hence providing a more critical chord shear condition due to the short "webs." The axial force present in the gap region of the chord member may also have an influence on the shear strength of the chord sidewalls in the gap region.

For K-connections, the scope covers both gapped and overlapped connections. Note that the latter are generally more difficult and more expensive to fabricate than K-connections with a gap. However, an overlapped connection will, in general, produce a connection with a higher static strength and fatigue resistance, as well as a stiffer truss than its gapped connection counterpart.

For rectangular HSS meeting the limits of applicability in Table K3.2A, the sole failure mode to be considered for design of overlapped connections is the limit state of uneven load distribution in the branches, manifested by either local buckling of the compression branch or premature yield failure of the tension branch. The design procedure presumes that one branch is welded solely to the chord and hence only has a single cut at its end. This can be considered good practice and the "thru member" is termed the overlapped member. For partial overlaps of less than 100%, the other branch is then double-cut at its end and welded to both the thru branch as well as the chord.

The branch to be selected as the “thru” or overlapped member should be the one with the larger overall width. If both branches have the same width, the thicker branch should be the overlapped branch.

For a single failure mode to be controlling (and not have failure by one branch punching into or pulling out of the other branch, for example), limits are placed on various connection parameters, including the relative width and relative thickness of the two branches. The foregoing fabrication advice for rectangular HSS also pertains

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_5.md -->

to round HSS overlapped K-connections, but the latter involves more complicated profiling of the branch ends to provide good saddle fits.

Overlapped rectangular HSS K-connection strength calculations (Equations K3-10, K3-11, and K3-12) are performed initially just for the overlapping branch, regardless of whether it is in tension or compression, and then the resistance of the overlapped branch is determined from that. The equations for connection strength, expressed as a force in a branch, are based on the load-carrying contributions of the four sidewalls of the overlapping branch and follow the design recommendations of the International Institute of Welding (IIW, 1989; Packer and Henderson, 1997; AWS, 2015). The effective widths of overlapping branch member walls transverse to the chord,  $ B_{e} $ , depend on the flexibility of the surface on which they land, and are derived from plate-to-HSS effective width measurements (Rolloos, 1969; Wardenier et al., 1981; Davies and Packer, 1982).

The applicability of Equations K3-10, K3-11, and K3-12 depends on the amount of overlap,  $ O_{v} $ , where  $ O_{v}=\left(l_{ov}/l_{p}\right)\times100 $ . It is important to note that  $ l_{p} $  is the projected length (or imaginary footprint) of the overlapping branch on the chord, even though it does not physically contact the chord. Also,  $ l_{ov} $  is the overlap length measured along the connecting face of the chord beneath the two branches. This is illustrated in Figure C-K2.1.

A maximum overlap of 100% occurs when one branch sits completely on the other branch. In such cases, the overlapping branch is sometimes moved slightly up the overlapped branch so that the heel of the overlapping branch can be fillet welded to the face of the overlapped branch. If the connection is fabricated in this manner, an overlap slightly greater than 100% is created. In such cases, the connection strength for a rectangular HSS connection can be calculated by Equation K3-12 but with the  $ B_{bi} $  term replaced by another  $ B_{e} $  term. Also, with regard to welding details, it has been found experimentally that it is permissible to just tack weld the "hidden toe" of the overlapped branch, providing that the components of the two branch member forces normal to the chord substantially balance each other and providing that the welds are designed for the yield capacity of the connected branch walls. The "hidden toe" should be fully welded to the chord if the normal components of the two branch forces differ by more than 20% or the welds to the branches are designed using an effective length approach. More discussion is provided in Commentary Section K5. If the components of the two branch forces normal to the chord do in fact differ significantly, the connection should also be checked for behavior as a T-, Y-, or cross-connection, using the combined footprint and the net force normal to the chord (see Figure C-K1.2).

For the design of round branches connecting to rectangular chords in T-, Y-, X-, and K-gapped connections under static loading, a conversion method can be used to check chord wall plastification if the branch to chord width ratio,  $ D_{b}/B $ , is less than 0.85. Supported by Packer et al. (2007), the conversion involves the replacement of the round branch (or branches) of diameter  $ D_{b} $  by equivalent square branches of width  $ B_{b} = \pi D_{b}/4 $  and the same thickness; then the design rule for chord wall

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_6.md -->

plastification in rectangular HSS-to-rectangular HSS connections in Table K3.2 can be applied to round HSS-to-rectangular HSS connections. For round HSS-to-rectangular HSS K-overlapped connections, the conversion method can be used if the chord width ratio,  $ D_{b}/B $ , is less than 0.8 to check local yielding of the branch or branches due to uneven load distribution for  $ \beta \geq 0.25 $ . Many failure modes for HSS connections depend on the perimeter or cross-sectional area of the branch member, and both the perimeter and area of a round HSS, when compared to that of a square HSS, have a ratio of  $ \pi/4 $ .

### K4. HSS-TO-HSS MOMENT CONNECTIONS

Section K4 on HSS-to-HSS connections under moment loading is applicable to frames with partially restrained or fully restrained moment connections, such as Vierendeel girders. The provisions of Section K4 are not generally applicable to typical planar triangulated trusses, which are covered by Section K3, because the latter should be analyzed in a manner that results in no bending moments in the web members. Thus, K-connections with moment loading on the branches are not covered by this Specification.

Available testing for HSS-to-HSS moment connections is much less extensive than that for axially loaded T-, Y-, cross-, and K-connections. Hence, the governing limit states to be checked for axially loaded connections can be used as a basis for the possible limit states in moment-loaded connections. Thus, the design criteria for round HSS moment connections are based on the limit states of chord plastification and punching shear failure, with  $ \phi $  and  $ \Omega $  factors consistent with Section K3, while the design criteria for rectangular HSS moment connections can be based on the limit states of plastification of the chord connecting face, uneven load distribution, and chord sidewall local yielding, crippling, and buckling. The “chord distortional failure” mode is applicable only to rectangular HSS T-connections with an out-of-plane bending moment on the branch. Rhomboidal distortion of the branch can be prevented by the use of stiffeners or diaphragms to maintain the rectangular cross-sectional shape of the chord. The limits of applicability of the equations in Section K4 are predominantly reproduced from Section K3. The equations in Section K4 have also been adopted in CIDECT Design Guide No. 9 (Kurobane et al., 2004). For additional information on chord sidewall failure due to in-plane and out-of-plane moments, reference CIDECT Design Guide No. 3, pp. 62 (Packer et al., 1992).

### K5. WELDS OF PLATES AND BRANCHES TO HSS

Section K5 consolidates all the welding rules for plates and branch members to a main (or through) HSS member into one section.

Due to differences in the relative flexibility of a main member, loaded by a force normal or inclined to its surface, and a branch member carrying a membrane force parallel to its surface, the transfer of load along the length of a weld is highly nonuniform. Thus, sometimes only a portion of the total weld length is effective in an HSS connection.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_7.md -->

One option to prevent progressive failure of the weld and establish ductile behavior of the joint for simple T-, Y-, and K-connections is to design welds at their ultimate strength to develop the branch member yield strength. This requirement is presumed to be satisfied when using matching filler metal and any of the prequalified joint details in AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020) for T-, Y-, and K-connections. For fillet welds loaded at  $ 90^{\circ} $  to the axis of the weld, it can be shown that this requirement is met—in most cases—if the effective throat of the weld is  $ \geq 0.95 $  times the branch member thickness, for branches with  $ F_{y} \leq 50 $  ksi (345 MPa) and 70 ksi (480 MPa) electrodes. The wall of a rectangular HSS branch that is loaded in tension is an exception, because the fillet weld directional strength increase factor does not apply (see Section J2.4), and in this case the required effective throat of the weld is  $ \geq 1.43 $  times the branch member thickness.

As an alternative option, welds to an HSS main member may be designed as "fit for purpose" to resist branch forces that are typically known in HSS truss-type connections by using what is known as the "effective length concept." Many HSS truss web members are subjected to low axial loads and in such situations, this weld design philosophy is ideal. However, the nonuniform loading of the weld perimeter due to the flexibility of the connecting HSS face must be taken into account by using weld effective lengths. Suitable effective lengths for plates and various HSS connections subjected to branch axial loading and/or moment loading, are given in Tables K5.1 and K5.2. These provisions are based on full-scale HSS connection and truss tests, supplemented by numerical modeling, that studied weld failures (Frater and Packer, 1992a, 1992b; Packer and Cassidy, 1995; McFadden and Packer, 2014; Packer et al., 2016; Tousignant and Packer, 2015, 2017a, 2017b, 2018, 2019).

Effective lengths used to determine weld sizing for rectangular HSS T-, Y-, and cross-connections with moments and for overlapped connections are based on a rational extrapolation of the effective length used for design of the branch member itself. Diagrams that show the locations of the effective weld lengths, most of which are less than 100% of the total weld length, are shown in Table K5.1 for connections to rectangular HSS and Table K5.2 for connections to round HSS.

For rectangular HSS, the effective length concept of weld design recognizes that a branch-to-main member connection becomes stiffer along its edges, relative to the center of the HSS face, as the angle of the branch to the connecting face and/or the width ratio (the width of a branch member relative to the connecting face) increase. Thus, the effective length used for sizing the weld may decrease as either the angle of the branch member (when over  $ 50^{\circ} $  relative to the connecting face) or the branch member width (creating width ratios over 0.85) increase. Note that for ease of calculation and because the error is insignificant, the weld corners were assumed as square for determination of the weld line section properties in certain cases.

When the welds in rectangular HSS overlapped joints are adequate to develop the strength of the remaining member walls, it has been found experimentally that it is permissible to eliminate the weld on the "hidden toe" of the overlapped branch, provided that the components of the two branch member forces normal to the chord substantially balance each other. The "hidden toe" should be fully welded to the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_8.md -->

chord if the normal components of the two branch forces differ by more than 20%. If the “fit for purpose” weld design philosophy is used in an overlapped joint, the hidden weld should be completed even though the effective weld length may be much less than the perimeter of the rectangular HSS branch. This helps account for the moments that can occur in typical HSS connections due to joint rotations and face deformations, but are not directly accounted for in design.

The design weld size in all cases shown in Table K5.1, including the hidden weld underneath an overlapped member as discussed in the foregoing, is the smallest weld throat around the connection perimeter. Adding up the strengths of individual sections of a weld group with varying throat sizes around the perimeter of the cross section is not a viable approach to HSS connection design.

# CHAPTER L DESIGN FOR SERVICEABILITY

Chapter L has no major changes or additions in this edition of the Specification.

### L1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Serviceability limit states are conditions in which the functions of a building are impaired because of local damage, deterioration or deformation of building components, or occupant discomfort. While serviceability limit states generally do not involve collapse of a building, loss of life, or injury, they can seriously impair the usefulness of a building and lead to costly repairs and other economic consequences. Serviceability provisions are essential to provide satisfactory performance of building structural systems. Neglect of serviceability may result in structures that are excessively flexible or otherwise perform unacceptably in service.

The general types of structural behavior that are indicative of impaired serviceability in steel structures are as follows:

(a) Excessive deflections or rotations that may affect the appearance, function, or drainage of the building, or may cause damaging transfer of load to nonstructural components and attachments

(b) Excessive drift due to wind that may damage cladding and nonstructural walls and partitions

(c) Excessive vibrations produced by the activities of the building occupants or mechanical equipment that may cause occupant discomfort or malfunction of building service equipment

(d) Excessive wind-induced motions that may cause occupant discomfort

(e) Excessive effects of expansion and contraction caused by temperature differences as well as creep and shrinkage of concrete and yielding of steel

(f) Effects of connection slip, resulting in excessive deflections and rotations that may have deleterious effects similar to those produced by load effects

In addition, excessive local damage (local yielding, buckling, slip, or cracking) or deterioration (weathering, corrosion, and discoloration) may also affect the function and serviceability of the structure during its service life.

Serviceability limit states depend on the occupancy or function of the building, the perceptions of its occupants, and the type of structural system. Limiting values of structural behavior intended to provide adequate levels of serviceability should be determined by a team consisting of the building owner/developer, the architect, and the structural engineer after a careful analysis of all functional and economic requirements and constraints. In arriving at serviceability limits, the team should recognize that building occupants are able to perceive structural deformations, motions, cracking, or other signs of distress at levels that are much lower than those that would

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_10.md -->

indicate impending structural damage or failure. Such signs of distress may be viewed as an indication that the building is unsafe and diminish its economic value and, therefore, must be considered at the time of design.

Service loads that may require consideration in checking serviceability include (1) static loads from the occupants, snow or rain on the roof, or temperature fluctuations; and (2) dynamic loads from human activities, wind effects, the operation of mechanical or building service equipment, or traffic near the building. Service loads are loads that act on the structure at an arbitrary point in time and may be only a fraction of the corresponding nominal load. The response of the structure to service loads generally can be analyzed assuming elastic behavior. Members that accumulate residual deformations under service loads also may require examination with respect to this long-term behavior.

Serviceability limit states and appropriate load combinations for checking conformance to serviceability requirements can be found in ASCE/SEI 7, Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures, Section 1.3.2, Commentary 1.3.2, Appendix C, and Commentary Appendix CC (ASCE, 2022).

### L2. DEFLECTIONS

Excessive vertical deflections and misalignment arise primarily from three sources: (a) gravity loads, such as dead, live, and snow loads; (b) effects of temperature, creep, and differential settlement; and (c) construction tolerances and errors. Such deformations may be visually objectionable; cause separation, cracking, or leakage of exterior cladding, doors, windows, and seals; and cause damage to interior components and finishes. Appropriate limiting values of deformations depend on the type of structure, detailing, and intended use (Galambos and Ellingwood, 1986). Historically, common deflection limits for horizontal members have been 1/360 of the span for floors subjected to reduced live load and 1/240 of the span for roof members. Deflections of about 1/300 of the span (for cantilevers, 1/150 of the length) are visible and may lead to general architectural damage or cladding leakage. Deflections greater than 1/200 of the span may impair operation of moveable components such as doors, windows, and sliding partitions.

Deflection limits depend very much on the function of the structure and the nature of the supported construction. Traditional limits expressed as a fraction of the span length should not be extrapolated beyond experience. For example, the traditional limit of 1/360 of the span worked well for controlling cracks in plaster ceilings with spans common in the first half of the twentieth century. Many structures with more flexibility have performed satisfactorily with the now common, and more forgiving, ceiling systems. On the other hand, with the advent of longer structural spans, serviceability problems have been observed with flexible grid ceilings where actual deflections were far less than 1/360 of the span, because the distance between partitions or other elements that may interfere with ceiling deflection are far less than the span of the structural member. Proper control of deflections is a complex subject requiring careful application of professional judgment. AISC Design Guide 3, Serviceability Design Considerations for Steel Buildings, 2nd Edition (West et al., 2003), provides an extensive discussion of the issues.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_11.md -->

Deflection computations for composite beams should include an allowance for slip, creep, and shrinkage as discussed in Commentary Section I3.

In certain long-span floor systems, it may be necessary to place a limit, independent of span, on the maximum deflection to minimize the possibility of damage of adjacent nonstructural elements (ISO, 1977). For example, damage to non-load-bearing partitions may occur if vertical deflections exceed more than about  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm) unless special provision is made for differential movement (Cooney and King, 1988); however, many components can and do accept larger deformations.

Load combinations for checking static deflections can be developed using a first-order reliability analysis (Galambos and Ellingwood, 1986). Current static deflection guidelines for floor and roof systems are adequate for limiting superficial damage in most buildings. A combined load with an annual probability of being exceeded of 5% is appropriate in most instances. For serviceability limit states involving visually objectionable deformations, repairable cracking, or other damage to interior finishes, and other short-term effects, the suggested load combinations are as follows:

 $$ D+L $$ 

 $$ D+0.5S $$ 

For serviceability limit states involving creep, settlement, or similar long-term or permanent effects, the suggested load combination is

 $$ D+0.5L $$ 

The dead load effect, D, may be that portion of dead load that occurs following attachment of nonstructural elements. For example, in composite construction, the dead load effects frequently are taken as those imposed after the concrete has cured. For ceiling related calculations, the dead load effects may include only those loads placed after the ceiling structure is in place.

### L3. DRIFT

Drift (lateral deflection) in a steel building is a serviceability issue primarily from the effects of wind. Drift limits are imposed on buildings to minimize damage to cladding and to nonstructural walls and partitions. Lateral frame deflection is evaluated for the building as a whole, where the applicable parameter is the total building drift, defined as the lateral frame deflection at the top of the highest occupied floor divided by the height of the building to that level,  $ \Delta/H $ . For each floor, the applicable parameter is interstory drift, defined as the lateral deflection of a floor relative to the lateral deflection of the floor immediately below, divided by the distance between floors,  $ \left(\delta_{n}-\delta_{n-1}\right)/h $ .

Typical drift limits in common usage vary from H/100 to H/600 for total building drift and h/200 to h/600 for interstory drift, depending on building type and the type of cladding or partition materials used. The most widely used values are H (or h)/400 to H (or h)/500 (ASCE, 1988). These limits generally are sufficient to minimize damage to cladding and nonstructural walls and partitions. Smaller drift limits may be appropriate if the cladding is brittle. AISC Design Guide 3 (West et al., 2003) contains recommendations for higher drift limits that have successfully

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_12.md -->

been used in low-rise buildings with various cladding types; it also contains recommendations for buildings containing cranes. An absolute limit on interstory drift is sometimes imposed by designers in light of evidence that damage to nonstructural partitions, cladding, and glazing may occur if the interstory drift exceeds about  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm), unless special detailing practices are employed to accommodate larger movements (Cooney and King, 1988; Freeman, 1977). Many components can accept deformations that are significantly larger. More specific information on the damage threshold for building materials is available in the literature (Griffis, 1993).

It is important to recognize that frame racking or shear distortion is the real cause of damage to building elements, such as cladding and partitions. Lateral drift only captures the horizontal component of the racking and does not include potential vertical racking, as from differential column shortening in tall buildings, which also contributes to damage. Moreover, some lateral drift may be caused by rigid body rotation of the cladding or partition which by itself does not cause strain and, therefore, damage. A more precise parameter, the drift damage index used to measure the potential damage, has been proposed (Griffis, 1993).

It must be emphasized that a reasonably accurate estimate of building drift is essential to controlling damage. The structural analysis must capture all significant components of potential frame deflection, including flexural deformation of beams and columns, axial deformation of columns and braces, shear deformation of beams and columns, beam-column joint rotation (panel-zone deformation), the effect of member joint size, and the  $ P-\Delta $  effect (Charney, 1990). For many low-rise steel frames with normal bay widths of 30 to 40 ft (9 to 12 m), use of center-to-center dimensions between columns without consideration of actual beam-to-column joint size and panel-zone effects will usually suffice for checking drift limits. The stiffening effect of nonstructural cladding, walls, and partitions may be taken into account if substantiating information (stress versus strain behavior) regarding their effect is available.

The level of wind load used in drift limit checks varies among designers depending upon the frequency with which the potential damage can be tolerated. Many designers use a 50-year, 20-year, or 10-year mean recurrence interval wind load when checking serviceability limit states (Griffis, 1993; ASCE, 2022).

It is important to recognize that drift control limits by themselves, in wind-sensitive buildings, do not provide for comfort of the occupants under wind load. See Section L5 for additional information regarding perception of motion in wind-sensitive buildings.

### L4. VIBRATION

The increasing use of high-strength materials with efficient structural systems and open plan architectural layouts leads to longer spans and more flexible floor systems having less damping. Therefore, floor vibrations have become an important design consideration. Acceleration is the recommended standard for evaluation.

An extensive treatment of vibration in steel-framed floor systems and pedestrian bridges is found in AISC Design Guide 11, Vibrations of Steel-Framed Structural

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_13.md -->

Systems Due to Human Activity (Murray et al., 2016). This guide provides basic principles and simple analytical tools to evaluate steel-framed floor systems and footbridges for vibration serviceability due to human activities, including walking and rhythmic activities. Both human comfort and the need to control movement for sensitive equipment are considered.

### L5. WIND-INDUCED MOTION

Designers of wind-sensitive buildings have long recognized the need for controlling annoying vibrations under the action of wind to protect the psychological well-being of the occupants (Chen and Robertson, 1972). The perception of building motion under the action of wind may be described by various physical quantities including maximum displacement, velocity, acceleration, and rate of change of acceleration (sometimes called "jerk"). Acceleration has become the standard for evaluation because it is readily measured in the field and can be easily calculated analytically. Human response to building motion is a complex phenomenon involving many psychological and physiological factors. Perception and tolerance thresholds of acceleration as a measure of building motion are known to depend on factors such as frequency of the building, occupant gender, age, body posture (sitting, standing, or reclining), body orientation, expectation of motion, body movement, visual cues, acoustic cues, and the type of motion (translational or torsional) (ASCE, 1981). Different thresholds and tolerance levels exist for different people and responses can be very subjective. It is known that some people can become accustomed to building motion and tolerate higher levels than others. Limited research exists on this subject, but certain standards have been applied for design as discussed in the following.

Acceleration in wind-sensitive buildings may be expressed as either root mean square (RMS) or peak acceleration. Both measures are used in practice and there is no clear agreement as to which is the more appropriate measure of motion perception. Some researchers believe that peak acceleration during wind storms is a better measure of actual perception but that RMS acceleration during the entire course of a wind storm is a better measure of actual discomfort. Target peak accelerations of 21 milli-g (0.021 times the acceleration of gravity) for commercial buildings occupied mostly during daylight hours and 15 milli-g for residential buildings occupied during the entire day under a 10-year mean recurrence interval wind storm have been successfully used in practice for many tall building designs (Griffis, 1993). The target is generally more strict for residential buildings because of the continuous occupancy, the perception that people are less sensitive and more tolerant at work than at home, the fact that there is more turnover in commercial buildings, and the fact that commercial buildings are more easily evacuated for peak wind events. Peak acceleration and RMS acceleration in wind-sensitive buildings are related by the “peak factor” best determined in a wind tunnel study and generally in the range of 3.5 for tall buildings (in other words, peak acceleration = peak factor × RMS acceleration). Guidance for design acceleration levels used in building design may be found in the literature (Chen and Robertson, 1972; Hansen et al., 1973; Irwin, 1986; NRCC, 1990; Griffis, 1993).

It is important to recognize that perception to building motion is strongly influenced by building mass and available damping as well as stiffness (Vickery et al., 1983).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_14.md -->

For this reason, building drift limits by themselves should not be used as the sole measure of controlling building motion (Islam et al., 1990). Damping levels for use in evaluating building motion under wind events are generally taken as approximately 1% of critical damping for steel buildings.

### L6. THERMAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION

The satisfactory accommodation of thermal expansion and contraction cannot be reduced to a few simple rules, but must depend largely upon the judgment of a qualified engineer. The problem is likely to be more serious in buildings with masonry walls than with prefabricated units. Complete separation of the framing at widely spaced expansion joints is generally more satisfactory than more frequently located devices that depend upon the sliding of parts in bearing, and usually less expensive than rocker or roller expansion bearings.

Creep and shrinkage of concrete and yielding of steel are among the causes, other than temperature, for dimensional changes. Conditions during construction, such as temperature effects before enclosure of the structure, should also be considered. Engineers may also consider that damage to building cladding can cause water penetration and may lead to corrosion. Guidelines for the recommended size and spacing of expansion joints in buildings may be found in NRC (1974).

### L7. CONNECTION SLIP

In bolted connections with bolts in holes having only small clearances, such as standard holes and slotted holes loaded transversely to the axis of the slot, the amount of possible slip is small. Slip at these connections is not likely to have serviceability implications. Possible exceptions include certain unusual situations where the effect of slip is magnified by the configuration of the structure, such as a connection at the base of a shallow cantilever beam or post where a small amount of bolt slip may produce unacceptable rotation and deflection.

This Specification requires that connections with oversized holes or slotted holes loaded parallel to the axis of the slot be designed as slip-critical connections. For a discussion of slip at these connections, see Commentary Section J3.9. Where slip at service loads is a realistic possibility in these connections, the effect of connection slip on the serviceability of the structure must be considered.

# CHAPTER M FABRICATION AND ERECTION

Chapter M includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Throughout this chapter, “Shop and Erection Drawings” have been changed to “Fabrication and Erection Documents” for consistency with AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (AISC, 2022a).

(2) Water jet cut bolt holes are now permitted.

(3) Manual thermal cut anchor rod holes are now permitted.

(4) Section M2.1 has been revised for clarity when considering heating limits for various grades of steel.

### M1. FABRICATION AND ERECTION DOCUMENTS

The AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges, ANSI/AISC 303, Section 4.2.1(a) (AISC, 2022a) requires the transfer of information from the contract documents into accurate and complete approval documents. Therefore, relevant items in the contract documents that must be followed in fabrication and erection should be placed on the fabrication and erection documents, or in typical notes issued for the project.

### M2. FABRICATION

### 1. Cambering, Curving, and Straightening

In addition to mechanical means, local application of heat is permitted for curving, cambering, and straightening. Maximum temperatures are specified in Section M2 for hot-rolled structural shapes, hollow structural sections (HSS), plates, and bars to avoid metallurgical damage and inadvertent alteration of mechanical properties. In general, these should not be viewed as absolute maximums; they include an allowance for a variation of about  $ 100^{\circ} $ F ( $ 38^{\circ} $ C), which is a common range achieved by experienced fabricators (FHWA, 1999).

For steels that are heat-treated through quenching and tempering and for steel products not addressed in Section M2, it is advisable to perform heat-assisted processing within temperature limitations established through recommendation by the producer of the material or the manufacturer of the steel product.

ASTM standards may include different grades within a standard. Instances exist where the heat shrinking limits are different for one grade than all other grades within the standard.

Temperatures should be measured by appropriate means, such as temperature-indicating crayons and steel color. Precise temperature measurements are seldom called for. Also, surface temperature measurements should not be made immediately after

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_16.md -->

removing the heating torch because it takes a few seconds for the heat to soak into the steel.

Local application of heat has long been used as a means of straightening or cambering beams and girders. With this method, selected zones are rapidly heated and tend to expand. But the expansion is resisted by the restraint provided by the surrounding unheated areas. Thus, the heated areas are “upset” (increase in thickness) and, upon cooling, they shorten to effect a change in curvature. In the case of trusses and girders, cambering can be built in during assembly of the component parts.

Although the desired curvature or camber can be obtained by these various methods, including at room temperature (cold cambering) (Bjorhovde, 2006), it must be realized that some deviation due to workmanship considerations, as well as some permanent change due to handling, is inevitable. Camber is usually defined by one mid-ordinate, because control of more than one point is difficult and not normally needed. Reverse cambers are difficult to achieve and are discouraged. Long cantilevers are sensitive to camber and may deserve closer control.

### 2. Thermal Cutting

Thermal cutting is preferably done by machine. The requirement in Section M2.2 for preheat before thermal cutting is to minimize the creation of a hard surface layer and the formation of cracks. This requirement for preheat for thermal cutting does not apply when the radius portion of the access hole or cope is drilled and the thermally cut portion is essentially linear. Such thermally cut surfaces are required to be ground in accordance with Section J1.6. After welding, the weld access hole surface is to be visually inspected in accordance with Table N5.4-3. The surface resulting from two straight torch cuts meeting at a point is not considered to be a curve.

### 4. Welded Construction

To avoid weld contamination, the light oil coating that is generally present after manufacturing an HSS should be removed with a suitable solvent in locations where welding will be performed. In cases where an external coating has been applied at the mill, the coating should be removed at the location of welding, or the manufacturer should be consulted regarding the suitability of welding in the presence of the coating.

### 5. Bolted Construction

In most connections made with high-strength bolts, it is only required to install the bolts to the snug-tight condition. This includes bearing-type connections where slip is permitted and, for ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A325 or A325M bolts only, tension or combined shear and tension applications where loosening or fatigue due to vibration or load fluctuations are not design considerations.

It is suggested that snug-tight bearing-type connections with ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A325 or A325M or ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A490 or A490M bolts be used in applications where ASTM A307 bolts are permitted.

This section provides rules for the use of oversized and slotted bolt holes paralleling the provisions that have been in the RCSC Specification for High-Strength Bolts.

since 1972 (RCSC, 2020), extended to include ASTM A307 bolts, which are outside the scope of the RCSC Specification.

The Specification previously limited the methods used to form bolt holes, based on common practice and equipment capabilities. Fabrication methods have changed and will continue to do so. To reflect these changes, this Specification has been revised to define acceptable quality instead of specifying the method used to form the bolt holes, and specifically to permit thermally cut and water jet cut bolt holes. AWS C4.1, Sample 3, is useful as an indication of the thermally cut profile that is acceptable (AWS, 1977). The use of numerically controlled or mechanically guided equipment is anticipated for the forming of thermally cut bolt holes. To the extent that the previous limitations may have related to safe operation in the fabrication shop, fabricators are referred to equipment manufacturers for equipment and tool operating limits.

### 10. Drain Holes

Because the interior of an HSS is difficult to inspect, concern is sometimes expressed regarding internal corrosion. However, good design practice can eliminate the concern and the need for expensive protection. Corrosion occurs in the presence of oxygen and water. In an enclosed building, it is improbable that there would be sufficient reintroduction of moisture to cause severe corrosion. Therefore, internal corrosion protection is a consideration only in HSS that are exposed to weather. In a sealed HSS, internal corrosion cannot progress beyond the point where the oxygen or moisture necessary for chemical oxidation is consumed (AISI, 1970). The oxidation depth is insignificant when the corrosion process must stop, even when a corrosive atmosphere exists at the time of sealing. If fine openings exist at connections, moisture and air can enter the HSS through capillary action or by aspiration due to the partial vacuum that is created if the HSS is cooled rapidly (Blodgett, 1967). This can be prevented by providing pressure-equalizing holes in locations that make it impossible for water to flow into the HSS by gravity.

Situations where an internal protective coating may be required include (1) open HSS where changes in the air volume by ventilation or direct flow of water is possible, and (2) open HSS subjected to a temperature gradient that causes condensation. In such instances, it may also be prudent to use a minimum  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) wall thickness.

HSS that are filled or partially filled with concrete should not be sealed. In the event of fire, water in the concrete will vaporize and may create pressure sufficient to burst a sealed HSS. Care should be taken so that water does not remain in the HSS during or after construction, because the expansion for HSS exposed to freezing can create pressure that is sufficient to burst an HSS. Galvanized HSS assemblies should not be completely sealed because rapid pressure changes during the galvanizing process tend to burst sealed assemblies.

### 11. Requirements for Galvanized Members

Cracking during hot-dip galvanizing has been observed in steel members. The occurrence of these cracks has been correlated to several characteristics including, but not limited to, the following:

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_18.md -->

• Abrupt geometric changes, such as copes, weld access holes, re-entrant corners with small radii, half depth end plates, and weld terminations—the severity of stress concentration has been linked with increased susceptibility to cracking during galvanizing.

• Cold-worked steel that has imperfections induced in the material from processing; grinding such details to reduce imperfections may improve performance.

• Thermally cut edges that are not ground.

• Welded assemblies involving significant differences in thickness, such as thick base plates welded to thin tubes for signs and light poles.

• Galvanizing practices, including care for cleaning acids, dipping speeds, and temperatures. Speeds faster than 18 ft/min (5.5 m/min) are preferred, as are shorter holding times.

• Zinc bath composition (Sn ≤ 0.1% is preferred, Pb + Bi ≤ 1.5% is preferred).

• Steel strength level (lower strength levels are less susceptible).

• Steel composition (Si, P, and B have been identified as nondesirable).

• Residual stresses from welding or thermal cutting (additional preheat and welding sequence may be used to mitigate residual stresses).

• Hardness greater than 270 HV may indicate increased susceptibility to cracking during hardening. Hardness measurements may be utilized to determine whether thermal pre-treatments should be applied before galvanizing.

The Specification requirement to grind thermally cut surfaces before galvanizing beam copes may not prevent all cope cracks from occurring during galvanizing; however, it has been shown to be an effective means to reduce the occurrence of this phenomenon. It can be useful to develop an inspection plan that concentrates on susceptible details. ASTM publishes the following standards related to galvanized structural steel.

• ASTM A123 (ASTM, 2017a) provides a standard for the galvanized coating and its measurement and includes provisions for the materials and fabrication of the products to be galvanized.

• ASTM A143/A143M (ASTM, 2020a) is a practice standard covering procedures that can be followed to safeguard against the possible embrittlement of steel hot-dip galvanized after fabrication and outlines test procedures for detecting embrittlement.

• ASTM A384/384M (ASTM, 2019a) is a practice standard that includes information on factors that contribute to warpage and distortion as well as suggestions for correction for fabricated assemblies.

• ASTM A385/385M (ASTM, 2020b) is a practice standard that includes information on base materials, venting, treatment of contacting surfaces, and cleaning. Many of these provisions should be indicated on the design and detail documents.

• ASTM A780/A780M (ASTM, 2020c) provides for repair of damaged and uncoated areas of hot-dip galvanized coatings.

• ASTM F2329/F2329M (ASTM, 2015c) covers the requirements for hot-dip zinc coating applied to carbon and alloy steel bolts, screws, washers, nuts, and special threaded fasteners.

### M3. SHOP PAINTING

### 1. General Requirements

The surface condition of unpainted steel framing of long-standing buildings that have been demolished has been found to be unchanged from the time of its erection, except at isolated spots where leakage may have occurred. Even in the presence of leakage, the shop coat is of minor influence (Bigos et al., 1954).

This Specification does not define the type of paint to be used when a shop coat is required. Final exposure and individual preference with regard to finish paint are factors that determine the selection of a proper primer. A comprehensive treatment of the subject is found in various Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) publications.

### 3. Contact Surfaces

Special concerns regarding contact surfaces of HSS should be considered. As a result of manufacturing, a light oil coating is generally present on the outer surface of the HSS. If paint is specified, HSS must be cleaned of this oil coating with a suitable solvent.

### 5. Surfaces Adjacent to Field Welds

This Specification allows for welding through surface materials, including appropriate shop coatings that do not adversely affect weld quality nor create objectionable fumes.

### M4. ERECTION

### 2. Stability and Connections

For information on the design of temporary lateral support systems and components for low-rise buildings, see AISC Design Guide 10, Erection Bracing of Low-Rise Structural Steel Buildings (Fisher and West, 1997).

### 4. Fit of Column Compression Joints and Base Plates

Tests on spliced full-size columns with joints that had been intentionally milled out-of-square, relative to either the strong- or weak-axis, demonstrated that the load-carrying capacity was the same as that for similar columns without splices (Popov and Stephen, 1977). In the tests, gaps of  $ \frac{1}{16} $  in. (2 mm) were not shimmed; gaps of  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm) were shimmed with nontapered mild steel shims. Minimum size partial-joint-penetration groove welds were used in all tests. No tests were performed on specimens with gaps greater than  $ \frac{1}{4} $  in. (6 mm).

### 5. Field Welding

The Specification incorporates AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020) by reference. Surface preparation requirements are defined in that code. The erector is responsible for repair of routine damage and corrosion occurring after fabrication. Welding on coated surfaces demands consideration of quality and safety. Wire brushing has been shown to result in adequate quality welds in many cases. Erector weld procedures

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_20.md -->

accommodate project site conditions within the range of variables normally used on structural steel welding. Welds to material in contact with concrete and welded assemblies in which shrinkage may add up to a substantial dimensional variance may be improved by judicious selection of weld procedure variables and fit-up. These conditions are dependent on other variables such as the condition and content of the concrete and the design details of the welded joint. The range of variables permitted in the class of weld procedures, considered to be prequalified in the process used by the erector, is the range normally used.

# CHAPTER N QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

Chapter N includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Section N1 now more accurately defines when quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) are required to be performed and by whom.

(2) Section N4 now addresses coating inspection personnel requirements.

(3) Tables N5.4-1 and N5.4-3 contain revised restrictions on die stamping.

(4) Section N8, Minimum Requirements for Shop- or Field-Applied Coatings, has been added.

This chapter on quality control and quality assurance does not address a number of applications associated with structural steel. The following is a list of references that may help with quality control and quality assurance for some of these items:

(1) Steel (open web) joists and joist girders—Each model specification of the Steel Joist Institute contains a section on quality

(2) Concrete reinforcing bars, concrete materials, or placement of concrete for composite members—ACI 318 and ACI 318M (ACI, 2019)

(3) Surface preparations for painting or coatings—SSPC Painting Manual, Volumes 1 and 2 (SSPC, 2002, 2012)

### N1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

This chapter provides minimum requirements for quality control (QC), quality assurance (QA), and nondestructive testing (NDT) for structural steel systems for buildings and other structures. Chapter N also addresses the inspection of field-installed shear stud connectors of composite slab construction that are frequently within the scope of the fabricator and erector. The inspection requirements for the other elements of composite construction, such as concrete, formwork, reinforcement, and the related dimensional tolerances, are addressed elsewhere. Three publications of the American Concrete Institute may be applicable. These are ACI 117, Specifications for Tolerances for Concrete Construction and Commentary (ACI, 2010a), ACI 301, Specifications for Structural Concrete (ACI, 2010b), and ACI 318 and ACI 318M, Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary (ACI, 2019). Minimum observation and inspection tasks deemed necessary to ensure quality structural steel construction are defined.

This chapter also defines a comprehensive system of quality control requirements on the part of the steel fabricator and erector and similar requirements for quality assurance on the part of the project owner's representatives when such is deemed necessary to complement the contractor's quality control function. These requirements exemplify recognized principles for developing involvement of all levels of management.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_22.md -->

ment and the workforce in the quality control process as the most effective method of achieving quality in the constructed product. The chapter supplements these quality control requirements with quality assurance responsibilities as are deemed suitable for a specific task. The requirements follow the same requirements for inspections utilized in AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020) and the RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts (RCSC, 2020), hereafter referred to as the RCSC Specification.

Under AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges, Section 8 (AISC, 2022a), hereafter referred to as the Code of Standard Practice, the fabricator or erector is to implement a QC system as part of their normal operations. Those that participate in AISC Quality Certification or similar programs are required to develop QC systems as part of those programs. The engineer of record (EOR) should evaluate what is already a part of the fabricator's or erector's QC system in determining the quality assurance needs for each project. Where the fabricator's or erector's QC system is considered adequate for the project, including compliance with any specific project needs, the special inspection or QA plan may be modified to reflect this. Similarly, where additional needs are identified, supplementary requirements should be specified.

The terminology adopted is intended to provide a clear distinction between fabricator and erector requirements and the requirements of others. The definitions of QC and QA used here are consistent with usage in related industries, such as the steel bridge industry, and they are used for the purposes of this Specification. It is recognized that these definitions are not the only definitions in use. For example, QC and QA are defined differently in the AISC Quality Certification program in a fashion that is useful to that program and are consistent with the International Standards Organization and the American Society for Quality.

For the purposes of this Specification, QC includes those tasks performed by the steel fabricator and erector that influence quality or are performed to measure or confirm quality. QA tasks performed by organizations other than the steel fabricator and erector are intended to provide a level of assurance that the product meets the project requirements.

The terms quality control and quality assurance are used throughout this Chapter to describe inspection tasks required to be performed by the steel fabricator and erector and project owner's representatives, respectively. The QA tasks are inspections often performed when required by the applicable building code or authority having jurisdiction (AHJ), and designated as special inspections, or as otherwise required by the project owner or EOR.

Chapter N defines two inspection levels for required inspection tasks and labels them as either “observe” or “perform.” The choice in terminology reflects the multi-task nature of welding and high-strength bolting operations, and the required inspections during each specific phase.

### N2. FABRICATOR AND ERECTOR QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM

Many quality requirements are common from project to project. Many of the processes used to produce structural steel have an effect on quality and are fundamental

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_23.md -->

and integral to the fabricator’s or erector’s success; consistency in imposing quality requirements between projects facilitates more efficient procedures for both.

The construction documents referred to in this chapter are, of necessity, the versions of the design documents, specifications, and approved fabrication and erection documents that have been released for construction, as defined in the Code of Standard Practice. When responses to requests for information and change orders exist that modify the construction documents, these also are part of the construction documents. When a building information model is used on the project, it also is a part of the construction documents.

Elements of a quality control program can include a variety of documentation, such as policies, internal qualification requirements, and methods of tracking production progress. Any procedure that is not apparent subsequent to the performance of the work should be considered important enough to be part of the written procedures. Any documents and procedures made available to the quality assurance inspector (QAI) should be considered proprietary and not distributed inappropriately.

The inspection documentation should include the following information:

(a) The product inspected

(b) The inspection that was conducted

(c) The name of the inspector and the time period within which the inspection was conducted

(d) Nonconformances and corrections implemented

Records can include marks on pieces, notes on drawings, process paperwork, or electronic files. A record showing adherence to a sampling plan for pre-welding compliance during a given time period may be sufficient for pre-welding observation inspection.

The level of detail recorded should result in confidence that the product is in compliance with the requirements.

### N3. FABRICATOR AND ERECTOR DOCUMENTS

### 1. Submittals for Steel Construction

The documents listed must be submitted so that the engineer of record (EOR) or the EOR’s designee can evaluate that the items prepared by the fabricator or erector meet the EOR’s design intent. This is traditionally done through the submittal of approval documents. For additional information concerning this process, refer to the Code of Standard Practice.

### 2. Available Documents for Steel Construction

The documents listed must be available for review by the EOR. Certain items are of a nature that submittal of substantial volumes of documentation is not practical, and therefore, it is acceptable to have these documents reviewed at the fabricator's or erector's facility by the engineer or designee, such as the QA agency. Additional commentary on some of the documentation listed in this section follows:

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_24.md -->

(a) This section requires documentation to be available for the fastening of deck. For deck fasteners, such as screws and power fasteners, catalog cuts and/or manufacturers installation instructions are to be available for review. There is no requirement for certification of any deck fastening products.

(b) Because the selection and proper use of welding filler metals is critical to achieving the necessary levels of strength, notch toughness, and quality, the availability for review of welding filler metal documentation and welding procedure specifications (WPS) is required. This allows a thorough review on the part of the engineer and allows the engineer to have outside consultants review these documents, if needed.

(c) The fabricator and erector maintain written records of welding personnel qualification testing. Such records should contain information regarding date of testing, process, WPS, test plate, position, and the results of the testing. In order to verify the six-month limitation on welder qualification, the fabricator and erector should also maintain a record documenting the dates that each welder has used a particular welding process.

(d) The fabricator should consider Code of Standard Practice Section 6.1 in establishing material control procedures for structural steel.

### N4. INSPECTION AND NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING PERSONNEL

### 1. Quality Control Inspector Qualifications

QC Inspectors (QCI) should be qualified in accordance with the fabricator's or erector's QC program. The QC program should require training and experience to provide basic knowledge of design documents and project specifications, fabrication and erection documents, code and specification requirements, and fabrication and/or erection practices. On-the-job training under the guidance of a qualified individual, as defined in the QC program, is acceptable.

QCI need not be proficient on all aspects of inspection but should be capable of performing the tasks they are assigned. For example, QCI who inspect fit-up should be familiar with the Fabrication clause of AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020); QCI who inspect work related to qualification of welding procedure specifications (WPS) or welding personnel should be familiar with the Qualification clause of AWS D1.1/D1.1M; and QCI who perform visual inspection should be familiar with the Inspection clause of AWS D1.1/D1.1M. Personnel working on projects where other AWS codes are the relevant welding code should be trained in the corresponding clauses of those codes.

Personnel assigned to inspect bolting-related functions should be trained and familiar with RCSC Specification chapters on Fastener Components, Bolted Parts, Use of Washers, Pre-Installation Verification, Installation, and Inspection.

QCI should be trained in proper documentation of inspections that may be required by contract documents or the QC program as applicable.

### 2. Quality Assurance Inspector Qualifications

The QA agency determines the qualifications, training, and experience required for personnel conducting the specified QA inspections. This may be based on the actual

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_25.md -->

work to be performed on any particular project. AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.1.4.2(5), states, "An individual who, by training or experience, or both, in metals fabrication, inspection and testing, is competent to perform inspection of the work." Qualification for the QA inspector may include experience, knowledge, and physical requirements. These qualification requirements are documented in the QA agency's written practice. AWS B5.1-AMD1 (AWS, 2013) is a resource for qualification of a welding inspector.

The use of assistant welding inspectors under direct supervision is as permitted in AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.1.4.4 and 8.1.4.5.

### 3. NDT Personnel Qualifications

NDT personnel should have sufficient education, training, and experience in those NDT methods they will perform. ASNT SNT-TC-1a (ASNT, 2020a) and ASNT CP-189 (ASNT, 2020b) prescribe visual acuity testing, topical outlines for training, written knowledge, hands-on skills examinations, and experience levels for the NDT methods and levels of qualification.

As an example, under the provisions of ASNT SNT-TC-1a, an NDT Level II individual should be qualified to set up and calibrate equipment and to interpret and evaluate results with respect to applicable codes, standards, and specifications. The NDT Level II individual should be thoroughly familiar with the scope and limitations of the methods for which they are qualified and should exercise assigned responsibility for on-the-job training and guidance of trainees and NDT Level I personnel. The NDT Level II individual should be able to organize and report the results of NDT tests.

### N5. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR INSPECTION OF STRUCTURAL STEEL BUILDINGS

### 1. Quality Control

The welding inspection tasks listed in Tables N5.4-1 through N5.4-3 are inspection items contained in AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020), but have been organized in the tables in a more rational manner for scheduling and implementation using categories of before welding, during welding, and after welding. Similarly, the bolting inspection tasks listed in Tables N5.6-1 through N5.6-3 are inspection items contained in the RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2020), but have been organized in a similar manner for scheduling and implementation using traditional categories of before bolting, during bolting, and after bolting. The details of each table are discussed in Commentary Sections N5.4 and N5.6.

Typical model building codes, such as the 2021 International Building Code (IBC) (ICC, 2021) or NFPA 5000 (NFPA, 2021b), make specific statements about inspecting to "approved construction documents"—the original and revised design documents and specifications as approved by the building official or authority having jurisdiction (AHJ). Code of Standard Practice Section 4.2.1(a) (AISC, 2022a) requires the transfer of information from the contract documents (design documents and project specifications) into accurate and complete fabrication and erection documents; therefore, relevant items in the design documents and project specifications

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_26.md -->

that must be followed in fabrication and erection should be placed on the fabrication and erection documents or in typical notes issued for the project. Because of this provision, QC inspection may be performed using fabrication documents and erection documents, not the original design documents.

The applicable referenced standards in construction documents are commonly this Specification, the Code of Standard Practice, AWS D1.1/D1.1M, and the RCSC Specification.

### 2. Quality Assurance

Code of Standard Practice Section 8.5.2 contains the following provisions regarding the scheduling of shop fabrication inspection: “Inspection of shop work by the inspector shall be performed in the fabricator’s shop to the fullest extent possible. Such inspections shall be timely, in-sequence, and performed in such a manner as will not disrupt fabrication operations and will permit the repair of nonconforming work prior to any required painting while the material is still in-process in the fabrication shop.”

Similarly, Code of Standard Practice Section 8.5.3 states, “Inspection of field work shall be promptly completed without delaying the progress or correction of the work.”

Code of Standard Practice Section 8.5.1 states, "The fabricator and the erector shall provide the inspector with access to all places where the work is being performed. A minimum of 24 hours notification shall be given prior to the commencement of work." However, the inspector's timely inspections are necessary for this to be achieved, while the scaffolding, lifts, or other means provided by the fabricator or erector for their personnel are still in place or are readily available.

IBC Section 2202.1 (ICC, 2021) states, "Identification of structural steel elements shall be in accordance with AISC 360.... Where the steel grade is not readily identifiable from marking and test records, the steel shall be tested to verify conformity to such standards."

Code of Standard Practice Section 6.1, Identification of Material, states, “The fabricator shall be able to demonstrate by written procedure and actual practice a method of material identification, visible up to the point of assembling members....”

Code of Standard Practice Section 8.2 states, "Material test reports shall constitute sufficient evidence that the mill product satisfies material order requirements. The fabricator shall make a visual inspection of material that is received from the mill, ...." Code of Standard Practice Sections 5.2 and 6.1 address the traceability of material test reports to individual pieces of steel and the identification requirements for structural steel in the fabrication stage.

Model building codes, such as the IBC or NFPA 5000 (NFPA, 2021b), make specific statements about inspecting to "approved construction documents" and the original and revised design documents and specifications as approved by the building official or the AHJ. Because of these IBC provisions, the QAI should inspect using the original and revised design documents and project specifications. The QAI may also use the fabrication documents and erection documents to assist in the inspection process.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_21/doc_27.md -->

### 3. Coordinated Inspection

Coordination of inspection tasks may be needed for fabricators in remote locations or distant from the project itself, or for erectors with projects in locations where inspection by a local firm or individual may not be feasible or where tasks are redundant.

The approval of both the AHJ and the engineer of record (EOR) is required for quality assurance to rely upon quality control, so there must be a level of assurance provided by the quality activities that are accepted. It may also serve as an intermediate step short of waiving QA as described in Section N6.

### 4. Inspection of Welding

AWS D1.1/D1.1M requires inspection, and any inspection task should be done by the fabricator or erector (termed contractor within AWS D1.1/D1.1M) under the terms of clause 8.1.2.1, as follows:

Contractor’s Inspection. This type of inspection and test shall be performed as necessary prior to assembly, during assembly, during welding, and after welding to ensure that materials and workmanship meet the requirements of the contract documents. Fabrication/erection inspection and testing shall be the responsibilities of the Contractor unless otherwise provided in the contract documents.

This is further clarified in clause 8.1.3.3, which states the following:

Inspector(s). When the term inspector is used without further qualification as to the specific inspector category described above, it applies equally to inspection and verification within the limits of responsibility described in 8.1.2.

The basis of Tables N5.4-1, N5.4-2, and N5.4-3 are inspection tasks, as well as quality requirements, and related detailed items contained within AWS D1.1/D1.1M. Commentary Tables C-N5.4-1, C-N5.4-2, and C-N5.4-3 provide specific references to clauses in AWS D1.1/D1.1M. In the determination of the task lists, and whether the task is designated "observe" or "perform," the pertinent terms of the following AWS D1.1/D1.1M clauses were used:

### 8.5 Inspection of Work and Records

8.5.1 Size, Length, and Location of Welds. The Inspector shall ensure that the size, length, and location of all welds conform to the requirements of this code and to the detail drawings and that no unspecified welds have been added without the approval of the Engineer.

8.5.2 Scope of Examinations. The Inspector shall, at suitable intervals, observe joint preparation, assembly practice, the welding techniques, and performance of each welder, welding operator, and tack welder to ensure that the applicable requirements of this code are met.

8.5.3 Extent of Examination. The Inspector shall examine the work to ensure that it meets the requirements of this code.... Size and contour of welds shall be measured with suitable gages.

“Observe” tasks are as described in clauses 8.5.2 and 8.5.3. Clause 8.5.2 uses the term “observe” and also defines the frequency to be “at suitable intervals.” “Perform” tasks are required for each weld by AWS D1.1/D1.1M, as stated in clause 8.5.1 or 8.5.3, or are necessary for final acceptance of the weld or item. The use of the term “perform” is based upon the use in AWS D1.1/D1.1M of the phrases “shall examine the work” and “size and contour of welds shall be measured”; hence, “perform” items are limited to those functions typically performed at the completion of each weld.

The words “all welds” in clause 8.5.1 clearly indicate that all welds are required to be inspected for size, length, and location to ensure conformity. Chapter N follows the same principle in labeling these tasks “perform,” which is defined as “Perform these tasks for each welded joint or member.”

The words “suitable intervals” used in clause 8.5.2 characterize that it is not necessary to inspect these tasks for each weld, but as necessary to ensure that the applicable

requirements of AWS D1.1/D1.1M are met. Following the same principles and terminology, Chapter N labels these tasks as “observe,” which is defined as “Observe these items on a random basis.”

The selection of suitable intervals as used in AWS D1.1/D1.1M is not defined within AWS D1.1/D1.1M, other than the AWS statement "to ensure that the applicable requirements of this code are met." The establishment of "at suitable intervals" is dependent upon the quality control program of the fabricator or erector, the skills and knowledge of the welders themselves, the type of weld, and the importance of the weld. During the initial stages of a project, it may be advisable to have increased levels of observation to establish the effectiveness of the fabricator's or erector's quality control program, but such increased levels need not be maintained for the duration of the project, nor to the extent of inspectors being on site. Rather, an appropriate level of observation intervals can be used that is commensurate with the observed performance of the contractor and their personnel. More inspection may be warranted for weld fit-up and monitoring of welding operations for complete-joint-penetration (CJP) and partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welds loaded in transverse tension, compared to the time spent on groove welds loaded in compression or shear, or time spent on fillet welds. More time may be warranted observing welding operations for multi-pass fillet welds, where poor quality root passes and poor fit-up may be obscured by subsequent weld beads when compared to single pass fillet welds.

The terms “perform” and “observe” are not to be confused with the terms “periodic special inspection” and “continuous special inspection” used in the IBC for other construction materials. Both sets of terms establish two levels of inspection. The IBC terms specify whether the inspector is present at all times or not during the course of the work. Chapter N establishes inspection levels for specific tasks within each major inspection area. “Perform” indicates each item is to be inspected and “observe” indicates samples of the work are to be inspected. It is likely that the number of inspection tasks will determine whether an inspector has to be present full time but it is not in accordance with Chapter N to let the time an inspector is onsite determine how many inspection tasks are done.

AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.3, states that the contractor's (fabricator's and erector's) inspector is specifically responsible for the welding procedure specifications (WPS), verification of prequalification or proper qualification, and performance in compliance with the WPS. Quality assurance inspectors monitor welding to make sure QC is effective. For this reason, Tables N5.4-1 and N5.4-2 maintain an inspection task for the QA for these functions. For welding to be performed, and for this inspection work to be done, the WPS must be available to both welder and inspector. A separate inspection for tubular T-, Y-, and K-connections was added to recognize the separate fit-up tolerances for these joints in AWS D1.1/D1.1M, Table 10.7, and their importance to achieving an acceptable root.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_1.md -->

Material verification of weld filler materials is accomplished by observing that the consumable markings correspond to those in the WPS and that certificates of compliance are available for consumables used.

AWS D1.1/D1.1M does not require a welding personnel identification system. However, the inspector must verify the qualifications of welders, including identifying those welders whose work "appears to be below the requirements of this code." Also, if welds are to receive nondestructive testing (NDT), it is essential to have a welding personnel identification system to reduce the rate of NDT for good welders and increase the rate of NDT for welders whose welds frequently fail NDT. This welder identification system can also benefit the contractor by clearly identifying welders who may need additional training.

Table N5.4-3 includes requirements for observation that “No prohibited welds have been added without the approval of the engineer of record.” AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 7.17, includes specific provisions for tack welds incorporated into final welds, tack welds not incorporated into final welds, and construction aid welds.

The footnote in Table N5.4-3 was revised to clarify the use of stamps to identify welders and when used by inspectors. AISC does not mandate the use of stamps to identify a welder's or inspector's work; however, if stamps are used as a system of identification on cyclically loaded members, they must be the low-stress type and the EOR must grant approval for use.

AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 9 on stud welding, includes requirements regarding the stud welding materials and their condition, base metal condition, stud application qualification testing, pre-production welding inspection and bend testing, qualification of the welding operator, visual inspection of completed studs and bend testing of certain studs when required, and the repair of nonconforming studs. For manually welded studs, special requirements apply to the stud base and the welding procedures.

The proper fit-up for groove welds and fillet welds prior to welding should first be checked by the fitter or welder, as applicable. Such detailed dimensions should be provided on the fabrication or erection documents, as well as included in the WPS. Fitters and welders must be equipped with the necessary measurement tools to ensure proper fit-up prior to welding.

AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.2 on inspection of materials and equipment, states that “The Contractor’s Inspector shall ensure that only materials and equipment conforming to the requirements of this code shall be used.” For this reason, the check of welding equipment is assigned to QC only and is not required for QA.

### 5. Nondestructive Testing of Welded Joints

### 5 a. Procedures

Buildings are considered to be subjected to static loading unless fatigue is specifically addressed as prescribed in Appendix 3. Section J2 provisions contain exceptions to AWS D1.1/D1.1M.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_2.md -->

### 5 b. CJP Groove Weld NDT

For statically loaded structures, AWS D1.1/D1.1M and this Specification have no specific nondestructive testing (NDT) requirements, leaving it to the engineer to determine the appropriate NDT method(s), locations, or categories of welds to be tested, and the frequency and type of testing (full, partial, or spot), in accordance with AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.15.

The Specification implements a selection of NDT methods and a rate of ultrasonic testing (UT) based upon a rational system of risk of failure. If based upon a model building code, such as the International Building Code (ICC, 2021) or NFPA 5000 (NFPA, 2021b), the applicable building code will assign every building or structure to one of four different risk categories. Where there is no applicable building code, then Section A1 requires that the risk category be assigned in accordance with ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022).

Complete-joint-penetration (CJP) groove welds loaded in tension applied transversely to their axis are assumed to develop the capacity of the smaller steel element being joined, and therefore, have the highest demand for quality. CJP groove welds in compression or shear are not subjected to the same crack propagation risks as welds subjected to tension. Partial-joint-penetration (PJP) groove welds are designed using a limited design strength when in tension, based upon the root condition, and therefore, are not subjected to the same high stresses and subsequent crack propagation risk as a CJP groove weld. PJP groove welds in compression or shear are similarly at substantially less risk of crack propagation than CJP groove welds.

Fillet welds are designed using limited strengths, similar to PJP groove welds, and are designed for shear stresses regardless of load application, and therefore, do not warrant NDT.

The selection of joint type and thickness ranges for ultrasonic testing (UT) are based upon AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.19.1, which limits the procedures and standards as stated in Part F of AWS D1.1/D1.1M to groove welds and heat-affected zones between the thicknesses of  $ \frac{5}{16} $  in. (8 mm) and 8 in. (200 mm), inclusive. The requirement to inspect 10% of CJP groove welds is a requirement that the full length of 10% of the CJP groove welds be inspected.

### 5 c. Welded Joints Subjected to Fatigue

CJP groove welds in butt joints so designated in Sections 5 and 6.1 of Appendix 3, Table A-3.1, require that internal soundness be verified using radiographic testing (RT) or ultrasonic testing (UT), meeting the acceptance requirements of AWS D1.1/D1.1M, clause 8.12.2 or 8.13.2, as appropriate.

### 5 e. Reduction of Ultrasonic Testing Rate

Reduction of the rate of UT from 100% is permitted for individual welders who have demonstrated a high level of skill by satisfying the requirements of this section.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_3.md -->

### 5 f. Increase in Ultrasonic Testing Rate

For risk category II, where 10% of CJP groove welds loaded in transverse tension are tested, an increase in the rate of UT is required for individual welders who have failed to demonstrate a high level of skill, established as a failure rate of more than 5%, after a sufficient number of their welds have been tested. To implement this effectively, and not necessitate the retesting of welds previously deposited by a welder who has a high reject rate established after the 20 welds have been tested, it is suggested that at the start of the work, a higher rate of UT be performed on each welder's completed welds.

### 6. Inspection of High-Strength Bolting

The RCSC Specification (RCSC, 2020), similar to AWS D1.1/D1.1M, defines bolting inspection requirements in terms of inspection tasks and scope of examinations. The RCSC Specification uses the term “routine observation” for the inspection of all pretensioned bolts, further validating the choice of the term “observe” in this chapter of the Specification.

Table N5.6-1 includes requirements for observation of "Fasteners marked in accordance with ASTM requirements." This includes the required package marking of the fasteners and the product marking of the fastener components in accordance with the applicable ASTM standard. As an example, ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A325 or A325M requires the following items for package marking: ASTM designation and type; size; name and brand or trademark of the manufacturer; number of pieces; lot number; purchase order number; and country of origin. ASTM F3125/F3125M Grade A325 or A325M also requires manufacturer identification and grade identification on the head of each bolt.

Snug-tightened joints are required to be inspected to ensure that the proper fastener components are used and that the faying surfaces are brought into firm contact during installation of the bolts. The magnitude of the clamping force that exists in a snug-tightened joint is not a consideration and need not be verified.

Pretensioned joints and slip-critical joints are required to be inspected to ensure that the proper fastener components are used and that the faying surfaces are brought into firm contact during the initial installation of the bolts. Pre-installation verification testing is required for all pretensioned bolt installations, and the nature and scope of installation verification will vary based on the installation method used. The following provisions from the RCSC Specification serve as the basis for Tables N5.6-1, N5.6-2, and N5.6-3.

##### 9.2.1. Turn-of-Nut Method Pretensioning

The Inspector shall:

(1) Observe the pre-installation verification testing required in Section 7;

(2) Verify by routine observation that the snug-tight condition has been achieved in accordance with Section 8.1; and

(3) Verify by routine observation that the bolting crew subsequently rotates the turned element relative to the unturned element by the amount specified in Table 8.1.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_4.md -->

Alternatively, when bolting assemblies are match-marked after snug-tightening of the joint but prior to pretensioning, visual inspection after pretensioning is permitted in lieu of routine observation. No further evidence of conformity is required.

A pretension that is greater than the value specified in Table 5.2 shall not be cause for rejection. A rotation that exceeds the required values, including tolerance, specified in Table 8.1 shall not be cause for rejection.

##### 9.2.2. Calibrated Wrench Method Pretensioning

The Inspector shall:

(1) Observe the pre-installation verification testing required in Section 7;

(2) Verify by routine observation that the snug-tight condition has been achieved in accordance with Section 8.1; and

(3) Verify by routine observation that the bolting crew subsequently applies the calibrated wrench to the nut. No further evidence of conformity is required.

A pretension that is greater than the value specified in Table 5.2 shall not be cause for rejection. The use of a torque greater than the minimum installation torque shall not be cause for rejection.

##### 9.2.3. Twist-Off-Type Tension Control Bolt Method Pretensioning

The Inspector shall:

(1) Observe the pre-installation verification testing required in Section 7;

(2) Verify by routine observation that the snug-tight condition has been achieved in accordance with Section 8.1 and that splined ends are intact after snug tightening; and

(3) Verify by routine observation that the splined ends are subsequently twisted off during pretensioning by the bolting crew. No further evidence of conformity is required.

A pretension that is greater than the value specified in Table 5.2 shall not be cause for rejection.

##### 9.2.4. Direct Tension Indicator Method Pretensioning

The Inspector shall:

(1) Observe the pre-installation verification testing required in Section 7.

(2) Verify by routine observation that the snug-tight condition has been achieved in accordance with Section 8.1, that the appropriate feeler gage is accepted in half or more of the spaces between the protrusions of the direct tension indicator, and that the protrusions are properly oriented away from the work. If the appropriate feeler gage is accepted in fewer than half of the spaces, the direct tension indicator shall be removed and replaced.

(3) After pretensioning, verify by routine observation that the appropriate feeler gage is refused entry into more than half of the spaces between the protrusions. No further evidence of conformity is required.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_5.md -->

A pretension that is greater than that specified in Table 5.2 or feeler gage refusal in all locations shall not be cause for rejection.

##### 9.2.5. Combined Method Pretensioning

The Inspector shall:

(1) Observe the pre-installation verification testing required in Section 7;

(2) Verify by routine observation that the bolting crew applies to the nut the initial torque used in pre-installation verification testing, that the plies have been brought into firm contact, and that the requirements of Section 8.1 have been met; and

(3) Verify by routine observation that the bolting crew properly rotates the turned element relative to the unturned element by the amount specified in Table 8.2. Alternatively, when bolting assemblies are match-marked after the initial application of the torque, but prior to pretensioning, visual inspection after pretensioning is permitted in lieu of routine observation. No further evidence of conformity is required.

A pretension that is greater than the value specified in Table 5.2 shall not be cause for rejection. A rotation that exceeds the required values, including tolerance, in Table 8.2, shall not be cause for rejection.

The presence of the inspector is dependent upon whether the installation method provides visual evidence of completed installation. Turn-of-nut installation with matchmarking, installation using twist-off bolts, and installation using direct tension indicators provides visual evidence of a completed installation, and therefore, "observe" is stated for these methods. Turn-of-nut installation without matchmarking and calibrated wrench installation provides no such visual evidence, and the inspector is to be "engaged" onsite, although not necessarily watching every bolt or joint as it is being pretensioned.

The inspection provisions of the RCSC Specification rely upon observation of the work, hence all tables use "observe" for the designated tasks. Commentary Tables C-N5.6-1, C-N5.6-2, and C-N5.6-3 provide the applicable RCSC Specification references for inspection tasks prior to, during, and after bolting.

### 7. Inspection of Galvanized Structural Steel Main Members

Cracks have been observed on the cut surfaces of rolled shapes, plates, and on the corners of hollow structural sections (HSS) that have been galvanized. The propensity for cracking is related to residual and thermal stresses, geometric stress concentrations, and a potential for hydrogen or liquid metal assisted cracking. These characteristics can be modified, but no provisions have been found that eliminate all potential for cracking. Inspection should be focused near changes in direction of the cut surface, at edges of welded details, or at changes in section dimensions. In HSS, indications may appear on the inside corner near the exposed end. The word "exposed" in this section is intended to mean the cut surface that is not covered by a weld or a connected part.

### 8. Other Inspection Tasks

IBC requires that anchor rods for steel be set accurately to the pattern and dimensions called for on the plans. In addition, it is required that the protrusion of the threaded ends through the connected material be sufficient to fully engage the threads of the nuts, but not be greater than the length of the threads on the bolts.

Code of Standard Practice Section 7.5.1 states that anchor rods, foundation bolts, and other embedded items are to be set by the owner's designated representative for construction. The erector is likely not on site to verify placement; therefore, it is assigned solely to the quality assurance inspector (QAI). Because it is not possible to verify proper anchor rod materials and embedment following installation, it is required that the QAI be onsite when the anchor rods are being set.

### N6. APPROVED FABRICATORS AND ERECTORS

This provision is not intended to duplicate quality control (QC) inspections with quality assurance (QA) inspections, but rather to make it clear that all QA inspections that are part of this chapter are to be performed and documented appropriately.

IBC Section 1704.2.5.1 (ICC, 2021) states that

Special inspections during fabrication are not required where the work is done on the premises of a fabricator approved to perform such work without special inspection.

Approval shall be based on review of the fabricator’s written fabrication procedures and quality control manuals that provide a basis for control of materials and workmanship, with periodic auditing of fabrication and quality control practices by an approved agency or the building official.

An example of how these approvals may be made by the building official or authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) is the use of the AISC Certification program. A fabricator certified to the AISC Standard for Certification Programs (AISC, 2020) meets the criteria of having a quality control manual, written procedures, and annual onsite audits conducted by AISC's independent auditing company, Quality Management Company, LLC. Similarly, steel erectors may be an AISC Certified Erector. The audits confirm that the company has the personnel, knowledge, organization, equipment, experience, capability, procedures, and commitment to produce the required quality of work for a given certification category.

Granting a waiver of QA inspections in a fabrication shop does not eliminate the required nondestructive testing (NDT) of welds; instead of being performed by QA, such inspections are instead performed by the fabricator's QC. Even when QA inspection is waived, the NDT reports prepared by the fabricator's QC are available for review by a third-party QA.

### N8. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SHOP- OR FIELD-APPLIED COATINGS

Requirements for surface preparation, coating materials and touch up, including their application, and inspection criteria should be provided in the contract documents.

In the case of paint, it is addressed in the Code of Standard Practice in three sections: Section 3.1, which lists information regarding shop painting that must be provided in the contract documents; Section 6.4, Shop Cleaning and Painting (see also Section 3.1); and Section 7.17, Field Painting, which states, "Neither the fabricator nor the erector is responsible to paint field bolt heads and nuts or field welds, nor to touch up abrasions of the shop coat, nor to perform any other field painting." If project requirements differ from the provisions of the Code of Standard Practice, including coatings other than paint, they should be addressed in the contract documents as "instructions to the contrary" as the Code of Standard Practice provides in Section 1.1.

# APPENDIX 1 DESIGN BY ADVANCED ANALYSIS

Appendix 1 has no major changes or additions in this edition of the Specification.

General provisions for designing for stability are presented in Chapter C, in which specific details are provided for the direct analysis method. This appendix provides details for explicitly modeling system and member imperfections and inelasticity within the analysis.

#### 1.1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The provisions of this appendix permit the use of analysis methods that are more sophisticated than those required by Chapter C. The provisions also permit the use of computational analysis (e.g., the finite element method) to replace certain Specification equations used to evaluate limit states covered by Chapters D through H, J, and K. The application of these provisions requires a complete understanding of the provisions of this appendix as well as the equations they supersede. It is the responsibility of the engineer using these provisions to fully verify the completeness and accuracy of the analysis software used for this purpose.

#### 1.2. DESIGN BY ELASTIC ANALYSIS

In more traditional approaches, design for stability involves the combination of employing an analysis to determine the required strengths of components and the use of prescriptive code equations to proportion components so that they have adequate available strengths. Many traditional second-order analysis methods commonly available to designers account for  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects in flexure, but typically do not prove that equilibrium is satisfied on the deformed geometry of the system. They may also not account for twisting effects that can cause additional second-order effects that sometimes should be considered in design. The resulting effects of this approximation, such as neglecting twisting effects, have traditionally been accounted for when proportioning components and historically have been incorporated as part of the design requirements of Chapters D through K.

With more sophisticated analysis software being made available to designers, it is now possible to extend design methods, such as the direct analysis method, to provide engineers more opportunities to better approach complex design problems. Examples include, but are not limited to, defining the unbraced length of an arch or defining the effective length of an unbraced Vierendeel truss in which the axial force in the compression chord varies along its length.

A rigorous second-order elastic analysis, in which equilibrium and compatibility are satisfied on the deformed geometry of the system and its components, combined with adequate stiffness reductions for representing potential inelasticity, will indicate that deflections and internal force and moments will become unbounded as a structural system or any of its components approach instability. With instabilities, such as flexural buckling of compressive members now being monitored by the analysis,

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_10.md -->

the check for adequate design strength can be simplified to only needing to confirm adequate cross-section strength.

In this method of design, it is very important for a designer to establish that the analysis adequately captures all applicable second-order effects (including twist of the member, which can be important in some situations). Guidance is provided in this Commentary with a benchmark problem so that it will be clear that all significant second-order effects are being considered in order to use this method of design.

This new design approach is very useful in problems where it is not clearly evident what the unbraced lengths actually are for members in compression. Examples of such a situation occur when designing an arch structure for in-plane buckling effects under axial load, or when designing a through-truss (pony truss) where the top chord is continuous and seemingly unbraced out of plane. For these types of problems, the designer can perform a rigorous second-order elastic analysis as defined in this appendix and avoid a direct consideration of length effects for axially loaded compression members, while using the member cross-sectional strength in the appropriate limit state design equations. In such a case, buckling and instability are accounted for in producing additional second-order moments and shears caused by member twist.

### 1. General Stability Requirements

This section references the five requirements from Chapter C that make up a rigorous second-order elastic analysis. The requirements are similar to those contained in earlier Specification requirements defining a traditional second-order analysis that considered  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects in flexure. Since 2016, they have included the requirement to capture twisting and torsional effects that must be included as part of the design in some problems with long unbraced lengths that are subjected to additional internal forces caused by member twist. A rigorous second-order analysis can also capture the beneficial effects of member torsional strength due to warping restraint, for software that is written to include this component of member torsional strength, which adds to the member strength when a member is subjected to twisting effects. Software programs that do consider member twisting by providing for equilibrium on the deformed shape under each increment of loading, but do not consider the beneficial effects of torsional strength due to warping restraint (consideration of the  $ C_{w} $  member property), will provide a conservative solution to the member internal forces. The designer is cautioned to carefully examine the effects of twist and resulting second-order effects for each problem when using this method of analysis.

It is noted that this method is currently restricted to doubly symmetric sections, including I-shapes, HSS, and box sections, because current analytical testing has generally taken place with these section types. The designer can consider using singly symmetric shapes or other shapes as long as an investigation is undertaken to confirm that the results are properly capturing twisting effects (Liu et al., 2019) and generally produce designs comparable to the traditional design approach as specified in Chapter C and the other design requirements contained in Chapters D through K.

### 2. Calculation of Required Strengths

The details for the level of second-order analysis required for use of this design method are contained in this section. Traditional second-order analysis methods readily available to designers in most modern software, and commonly used in recent years, have traditionally only included flexural second-order effects defined by the  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects. These effects are explained in detail in Commentary Section C2. The difference between these traditional second-order analysis methods and the more rigorous second-order analysis referred to herein is the additional requirement for consideration of member twist, which results when an unbraced member is subjected to transverse load with or without axial load and containing an initial imperfection, such as camber or sweep, perpendicular to the plane of loading. Twist can also occur due to biaxial bending in a beam alone or in a beam-column with or without transverse loading that contains an out-of-plane imperfection.

Any analysis method that properly considers twist in a member due to an out-of-plane imperfection, or simply due to the tendency to twist under the effects of elastic or inelastic lateral-torsional buckling, will have additional moments caused by the twisting that must be resisted in the design. It has been found that twist becomes an important consideration in unbraced wide-flange sections as the unbraced length of the member approaches  $ L_{r} $  and as the ratio of strong-axis to weak-axis moment stiffness and strength increases. For such cases, the member capacity is reached with twist of the cross section in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 rad. Software that considers twisting effects using a large displacement analysis, where equilibrium is accounted for during each increment of loading in a line element member model, or software that contains additional degrees of freedom (14 degrees of freedom) in a line element member model that includes twisting and warping restraint effects, is able to pick up these additional second-order effects not customarily accounted for in traditional software using a 12-degree-of-freedom line element member model considering only  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects. While finite element models are able to pick up twisting and warping restraint effects and are readily available in some commercial software, they are not routinely used in a design office practice for most analyses.

Deformations to Be Considered in the Analysis. The requirements for exactly what imperfection deformations are to be modeled as part of the rigorous second-order analysis is left to the designer for each particular design case. Normally, the imperfection limits (camber, sweep, and twist) specified in the various ASTM Specifications for the member type would be consulted. Typically, for W-shape column members, an imperfection out-of-plane of 1/1,000 times the member's unbraced length would be used, unless a larger or smaller tolerance is justified by the fabrication. Generally, it is only necessary to consider the imperfection about the axis where buckling is likely to occur. It has been observed that the second-order internal forces in a member are incurred because of the natural tendency of the member to twist under loading, regardless of the imperfection used in the analysis. The important point is for some member perturbation to exist for the second-order effects to be picked up in the rigorous second-order analysis. For system imperfections caused by erection tolerances, the 1/500 out-of-plumbness, or a similar deviation in the nominal member end locations, should be included in the analysis unless justification exists.

for the particular design case that warrants use of a different level of erection tolerance. Regardless of the imperfection chosen for the analysis, it is important for the designer to understand the sensitivity of the analysis results to the level of imperfection chosen. Past studies have shown that the second-order internal forces can be very sensitive to the magnitude of the imperfection chosen, especially in the case of member twist. Some analysis software may only consider the effects of member twist by using a large displacement algorithm that considers member equilibrium in the deformed shape produced by each applied load increment, but without any consideration of the beneficial effects of torsional strength from warping resistance of the cross section. Using the internal member force results from such an analysis is conservative.

If these additional second-order effects caused by member twist are accounted for in the structural analysis, it is possible to design the members for axial load using their cross-sectional strength, without consideration of flexural or flexural-torsional buckling of members caused by unbraced length effects.

Adjustments to Stiffness. Partial yielding accentuated by residual stresses in members can produce a general softening of the structure at the strength limit state that further creates destabilizing effects. The design method provided in this section is similar to the direct analysis method presented in Chapter C, and is also calibrated against distributed-plasticity analyses that account for the spread of yielding through the member cross section and along the member length. In these calibration studies, the residual stresses in W-shapes were assumed to have a maximum value of  $ 0.3F_{y} $  in compression at the flange tips, and a distribution matching the so-called Lehigh pattern—a linear variation across the flanges and uniform tension in the web (Ziemian, 2010).

Reduced stiffnesses,  $ EI^{*}=0.8\tau_{b}EI $  and  $ EA^{*}=0.8EA $ , are used in the method provided in this section, just as it is for the direct analysis method of Chapter C. However, the stiffness reduction of 0.8 is also required for all other member properties, including J and  $ C_{w} $ , to properly account for twisting effects in the analysis. The  $ \tau_{b} $  factor is similar to the inelastic stiffness reduction factor implied in the column curve to account for loss of stiffness under high compression loads when  $ \alpha P_{r}>0.5P_{y} $ , and the 0.8 factor accounts for additional softening under combined axial compression and bending. It is a fortuitous coincidence that the reduction coefficients for both slender and stocky columns are close enough, such that the single reduction factor of  $ 0.8\tau_{b} $  works fairly well over the full range of slenderness. The use of reduced stiffness only pertains to analyses for strength and stability limit states. It does not apply to analyses for other stiffness-based conditions and criteria, such as for drift, deflection, vibration, and period determination.

For ease of application in design practice, where  $ \tau_{b}=1.0 $ , the 0.8 reduction on I, A, J, and  $ C_{w} $  can be applied by modifying E and G by 0.8 in the analysis. However, for computer software that does semi-automated design, one should confirm that the reduced E and G are applied only for the second-order analysis. The elastic modulus should not be reduced in nominal strength equations that include E for consideration of local buckling or slender-element effects.

Analysis Benchmark Problem. It is important for an engineer to understand the capabilities and limitations of the analysis software used in design. In order to provide a confidence level that a program is able to account for the second-order effects caused by the combination of axial force, flexure, and twist, it is strongly suggested that several benchmark problems be run to confirm the adequacy of the software being used. The following benchmark problem has been developed as one to consider in evaluating the accuracy of the analysis software required for application of the design method provided in Appendix 1, Section 1.2.

The results of an analysis procedure that does not consider member twist versus a procedure that does is demonstrated in Figure C-A-1.1. In this case, a member is subjected to loading that results in major-axis and minor-axis bending. As the figure indicates, a simply supported member with only ends restrained against twisting and simultaneously subjected to major-axis and minor-axis flexure will, in reality, twist to some extent. This twisting changes the magnitude of the components of major-axis and minor-axis moments when they are resolved to a coordinate system that references the cross-section axes of the deformed (twisted) state of the member.

Table C-A-1.1 provides numerical results at midspan for a W18×65 beam-column spanning 20 ft and subjected to four different combinations of loading. The axial and uniformly distributed loads are assumed factored and are applied proportionally.

The uniformly distributed load is applied in the vertical gravity direction throughout the loading history. The member is simply supported with rotation at the member ends restrained from twisting, with warping unrestrained. Therefore, the member ends are torsionally pinned (Seaburg and Carter, 1997). With a  $ \tau $ -factor equaling 1.0, because the axial force in all combinations is less than 0.5 times the axial yield force, the stiffness reduction applied to all section properties, including A,  $ I_{x} $ ,  $ I_{y} $ , J, and  $ C_{w} $ , is 0.8 (or equivalently, the factor 0.8 could be applied to both E and G). To provide some degree of transparency in the results, and because the length-to-height and length-to-width ratios of the member are approximately 13 and 32, respectively, shear deformations have been assumed negligible and are therefore neglected. For each combination of loading, three sets of results are provided. In many commercial analysis software programs, the default setting for including shear deformations should be turned off when making comparisons with the tabulated results provided.

In Table C-A-1.1, rows labeled (a) provide analysis results from a traditional second-order analysis meeting the requirements of Section C2.1. In this case, a nominally straight member is assumed and only in-plane  $ P-\delta $  effects on flexure need be considered. With no out-of-plane behavior occurring, there is no resulting twist, out-of-plane deflection, or minor-axis bending moments. According to Section C3, the interaction of axial force and flexure is assessed by the requirements of Chapter H, in which the nominal compressive strength defined in Section E3 is based on an effective length equaling the unbraced length of the member.

Analysis results provided in rows (b) and (c) of Table C-A-1.1 correspond to the requirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.2. In these cases, an out-of-plane member imperfection in the shape of a sine curve with an amplitude of L/1,000 at midspan is included in the computational model. A more rigorous elastic analysis procedure is employed that establishes that equilibrium and compatibility are satisfied on the deformed shape of the member, and thereby includes second-order effects attributed to both P- $ \delta $  and twist effects. Hence, the combination of the applied loads (P and  $ w_{y} $ ), initial out-of-plane imperfection ( $ \delta_{ox} = L/1,000 $ ), and the resulting deflections and twist ( $ \delta_{x} $ ,  $ \delta_{y} $ , and  $ \theta $ ) produce both major-axis and minor-axis bending moments, which at midspan are

 $$ M_{u x}^{\prime}=\left(\frac{w_{y}L^{2}}{8}+P\delta_{y}\right)\cos\theta-P\big(\delta_{o x}+\delta_{x}\big)\sin\theta $$ 

 $$ M_{uy}^{\prime}=\left(\frac{w_{y}L^{2}}{8}+P\delta_{y}\right)\sin\theta+P\big(\delta_{ox}+\delta_{x}\big)\cos\theta $$ 

In calculating the results given in row (b), the warping resistance of the section produced by cross-flange bending along the length of the member is neglected  $ (EC_{w}=0) $  and torsional resistance is provided only by St. Venant stiffness (GJ). Such warping resistance, as well as the St. Venant stiffness, is included in the analysis results provided in row (c).

The beneficial effects of including warping resistance are evident by significant reductions in deflections  $ (\delta_{x}, \delta_{y}, \text{and } \theta) $  and minor-axis bending moments. Based on Appendix 1, Section 1.2.3, the interaction of axial force and flexure is assessed according to the requirements of Chapter H, in which the nominal compressive strength,  $ P_{n} $ , is taken as the cross-section compressive strength,  $ P_{ns} $ , as defined in Section C2.3, and for this nonslender section is  $ F_{y}A_{g} $ . In all cases, the nominal major-axis and minor-axis flexural strengths are determined according to the provisions of Chapter F.

Analysis with Factored Loads. As with the direct analysis method presented in Chapter C and because of the high nonlinearity associated with second-order effects, it is essential that the analysis of the system be made with loads factored to the strength limit-state level. The Specification requirements for consideration of initial imperfections are intended to apply only to analyses for strength limit states. It is not necessary, in most cases, to consider initial imperfections in analyses for serviceability conditions such as drift, deflection, and vibration.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_16.md -->

Where concrete shear walls or other nonsteel components contribute to the stability of the structure and the governing codes or standards for those elements specify a greater stiffness reduction, the greater reduction should be applied.

### 3. Calculation of Available Strengths

When the analysis meets the requirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.2.2, the member cross-sectional strength provisions for available strength in axially loaded members from Chapters D, E, and H can be used; otherwise, the provisions in Chapters F through K complete the process of design by this method. The effects of local buckling and reductions in member capacity because of slender elements of the member must still be considered for  $ P_{n} $ . The effective length factor, K, and member buckling from length effects in axially loaded members in general need not be considered because they are directly accounted for in the structural analysis. The interaction of flexure and compression should be checked at all points along the member length, with the nominal flexural strengths,  $ M_{n} $ , determined from Chapter F.

It should be noted that the AASHTO Specification (AASHTO, 2014) addresses the consideration of flange lateral bending due to minor-axis bending moment, plus warping due to torsion, in the design of general curved and straight I-section members for flexure. White and Grubb (2005) provides an overview of the background to these equations. For beam-columns with significant flange bending due to twist, the minor-axis flexural capacity ratio for the flange subjected to the largest combined lateral bending due to overall minor-axis bending plus torsion may be used with Equation H1-1 as a conservative assessment. Aghayere and Vigil (2014) provide a straightforward discussion of this type of calculation with references to additional background research studies.

Where beams and columns rely upon braces for stability, they should generally be included as part of the lateral force-resisting system in the analysis. As long as imperfections are considered as specified, sufficient strength and stiffness to control member movement at the brace points can automatically be assessed.

#### 1.3. DESIGN BY INELASTIC ANALYSIS

This section contains provisions for the inelastic analysis and design of structural steel systems, including continuous beams, moment frames, braced frames, and combined systems. This appendix was modified in 2016 to allow for the use of a wider range of inelastic analysis methods, varying from the traditional plastic design approaches to the more advanced nonlinear finite element analysis methods. In several ways, this appendix represents a logical extension of the direct analysis method of Chapter C, in which second-order elastic analysis is used. The provision for moment redistribution in continuous beams, which is permitted for elastic analysis only, is provided in Appendix 8.

### 1. General Requirements

These requirements directly parallel the general requirements of Chapter C and are further discussed in Commentary Section C1.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_17.md -->

Various levels of inelastic analysis are available to the designer (Ziemian, 2010; Chen and Toma, 1994). All are intended to account for the potential redistribution of member and connection forces and moments that are a result of localized yielding as a structural system reaches a strength limit state. At the higher levels, they have the ability to model complex forms of nonlinear behavior and detect member and frame instabilities well before the formation of a plastic mechanism. Many of the strength design equations in this Specification, for members subjected to compression, flexure, and combinations thereof, were developed using refined methods of inelastic analysis along with experimental results and engineering judgment (Yura et al., 1978; Kanchanalai and Lu, 1979; Bjorhovde, 1988; Ziemian, 2010). Also, the following research has provided significant advances in procedures for the direct application of second-order inelastic analysis in design: Ziemian et al. (1992); White and Chen (1993); Liew et al. (1993); Ziemian and Miller (1997); Chen and Kim (1997); and Surovek (2010). Correspondingly, there has been a steady increase in the inclusion of provisions for inelastic analysis in commercial steel design software, but the level varies widely. Use of any analysis software requires an understanding of the aspects of structural behavior it simulates, the quality of its methods, and whether or not the software's ductility and analysis provisions are equivalent to those of Appendix 1, Sections 1.2 and 1.3. There are numerous studies available for verifying the accuracy of an inelastic analysis (Kanchanalai, 1977; El-Zanaty et al., 1980; White and Chen, 1993; Maleck and White, 2003; Martinez-Garcia and Ziemian, 2006; Ziemian, 2010).

With this background, it is the intent of this appendix to allow certain levels of inelastic analysis to be used in place of the Specification design equations as a basis for confirming the adequacy of a member or system. In all cases, the strength limit state behavior being addressed by the corresponding provisions of the Specification needs to be considered. For example, Section E3 provides equations that define the nominal compressive strength corresponding to the flexural buckling of members without slender elements. The strengths determined by these equations account for many factors, which primarily include the initial out-of-straightness of the compression member, residual stresses that result from the fabrication process, and the reduction of flexural stiffness due to second-order effects and partial yielding of the cross section. If these factors are directly incorporated within the inelastic analysis and a comparable or higher level of reliability can be confirmed, then the specific strength equations of Section E3 need not be evaluated. In other words, the inelastic analysis will indicate the limit state of flexural buckling and the design can be evaluated accordingly. On the other hand, suppose that the same inelastic analysis is not capable of modeling flexural-torsional buckling. In this case, the provisions of Section E4 would need to be evaluated. Other examples of strength limit states not detected by the analysis may include, but are not limited to, lateral-torsional buckling strength of flexural members, connection strength, and shear yielding or buckling strengths.

Item (e) of the General Requirements given in Appendix 1, Section 1.3.1, states that “uncertainty in system, member, and connection strength and stiffness” shall be taken into account. Member and connection reliability requirements are fulfilled by the probabilistically derived resistance factors and load factors of the load and resistance factor design method of this Specification. System reliability considerations are

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_18.md -->

still a project-by-project exercise and no overall methods have, as yet, been developed for steel building structures. Introduction to the topic of system reliability can be found in textbooks, for example, Ang and Tang (1984), Thoft-Christensen and Murotsu (1986), and Nowak and Collins (2000), as well as in many publications, for example, Buonopane and Schafer (2006).

Because this type of analysis is inherently conducted at ultimate load levels, the provisions of this appendix are limited to the design basis of Section B3.1 (LRFD).

In accordance with Section B3.8, the serviceability of the design should be assessed with specific requirements given in Chapter L. In satisfying these requirements in conjunction with a design method based on inelastic analysis, consideration should be given to the degree of steel yielding permitted at service loads. Of particular concern are (a) permanent deflections that may occur due to steel yielding, and (b) stiffness degradation due to yielding and whether this is modeled in the inelastic analysis.

Although the use of inelastic analysis has great potential in earthquake engineering, the specific provisions beyond the general requirements of this appendix do not apply to seismic design. The two primary reasons for this are as follows:

(a) In defining “equivalent” static loads for use in elastic seismic design procedures, member yielding and inelastic force redistribution is already implied through the specification of seismic response modification factors (R-factors) that are greater than unity. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to use the equivalent seismic loads with a design approach based on inelastic analysis.

(b) The ductility requirements for seismic design based on inelastic analysis are more stringent than those provided in this Specification for nonseismic loads.

Criteria and guidelines for the use of inelastic analysis and design for seismic applications are provided in Chapter 16 of the ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022), ASCE/SEI 41 (ASCE, 2017), and Resource Paper 9, "Seismic Design Using Target Drift, Ductility, and Plastic Mechanism as Performance Criteria" in the NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures (FEMA, 2009). As described in these documents, when nonlinear (inelastic) static analysis is used for seismic design, the earthquake loading effects are typically quantified in terms of target displacements that are determined from ground motion spectral acceleration. Alternatively, for nonlinear (inelastic) dynamic analysis, the earthquake loading effects are defined in terms of input ground motions that are selected and scaled to match ground motion spectra. For the seismic design of new buildings, capacity design strategies are highly recommended to control the locations of inelastic action to well-defined mechanisms (FEMA, 2009; Deierlein et al., 2010).

Connections adjacent to plastic hinges must be designed with sufficient strength and ductility to sustain the forces and deformations imposed under the required loads. The practical implementation of this rule is that the applicable requirements of Section B3.4 and Chapter J must be strictly adhered to. These provisions for connection design have been developed from plasticity theory and verified by extensive testing, as discussed in ASCE (1971) and in many books and papers. Thus, the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_19.md -->

connections that meet these provisions are inherently qualified for use in designing structures based on inelastic analysis.

Any method of design that is based on inelastic analysis and satisfies the given general requirements is permitted. These methods may include the use of nonlinear finite element analyses (Crisfield, 1991; Bathe, 1995) that are based on continuum elements to design a single structural component, such as a connection, or the use of second-order inelastic frame analyses (McGuire et al., 2000; Clarke et al., 1992) to design a structural system consisting of beams, columns, and connections.

Appendix 1, Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, collectively define provisions that can be used to satisfy the ductility and analysis requirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.3.1. They provide the basis for an approved second-order inelastic frame analysis method. These provisions are not intended to preclude other approaches meeting the requirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.3.1.

### 2. Ductility Requirements

Because an inelastic analysis will provide for the redistribution of internal forces due to yielding of structural components such as members and connections, it is imperative that these components have adequate ductility and be capable of maintaining their design strength while accommodating inelastic deformation demands. Factors that affect the inelastic deformation capacity of components include the material properties, the slenderness of cross-sectional elements, and the unbraced length. There are two general methods for assuring adequate ductility: (1) limiting the aforementioned factors, and (2) making direct comparisons of the actual inelastic deformation demands with predefined values of inelastic deformation capacities. The former is provided in this appendix. It essentially decouples inelastic local buckling from inelastic lateral-torsional buckling. It has been part of the plastic design provisions for several previous editions of the Specification. Examples of the latter approach in which ductility demands are compared with defined capacities appear in Galambos (1968b), Kato (1990), Kemp (1996), Gioncu and Petcu (1997), FEMA 350 (FEMA, 2000), ASCE/SEI 41 (ASCE, 2017), and Ziemian (2010).

### 2 a. Material

Extensive past research on the plastic and inelastic behavior of continuous beams, rigid frames, and connections has amply demonstrated the suitability of steel with yield stress levels up to 65 ksi (450 MPa) (ASCE, 1971).

### 2 b. Cross Section

Design by inelastic analysis requires that, up to the peak of the structure's load-deflection curve, the moments at the plastic hinge locations remain at the level of the plastic moment, which itself should be reduced for the presence of axial force. This implies that the member must have sufficient inelastic rotation capacity to permit the redistribution of additional moments. Sections that are designated as compact in Section B4 have a minimum rotation capacity of approximately  $ R_{cap} = 3 $  (see Figure C-A-1.2) and are suitable for developing plastic hinges. The limiting width-to-thickness ratio designated as  $ \lambda_{p} $  in Table B4.1b, and designated as  $ \lambda_{pd} $  in this appendix, is the maximum slenderness ratio that will permit this rotation capacity to be achieved.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_20.md -->

Further discussion of the antecedents of these provisions is given in Commentary Section B4.

The additional slenderness limits in Equations A-1-1 through A-1-4 apply to cases not covered in Table B4.1b. Equations A-1-1 and A-1-2, which define width-to-thickness ratio limits of webs of wide-flange sections, rectangular HSS, and box sections under combined flexure and compression, have been part of the plastic design requirements in the Specification since the 1969 edition (AISC, 1969) and are based on research documented in Plastic Design in Steel, a Guide and a Commentary (ASCE, 1971). The equations for the flanges of HSS and box sections (Equation A-1-3), and for round HSS sections (Equation A-1-4), are from the Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification for Steel Hollow Structural Sections (AISC, 2000a).

Limiting the slenderness of elements in a cross section so that there is ductility at plastic hinge locations is permissible only for doubly symmetric shapes. In general, single-angle, tee, and double-angle sections are not permitted for use in plastic design because the inelastic rotation capacity in the regions where the moment produces compression in an outstanding leg will typically not be sufficient.

### 2 c. Unbraced Length

The ductility of structural members with plastic hinges can be significantly reduced by the possibility of inelastic lateral-torsional buckling. In order to provide adequate rotation capacity, such members may need more closely spaced bracing than would be otherwise needed for design in accordance with elastic theory. Equations A-1-5 and A-1-7 define the maximum permitted unbraced length in the vicinity of plastic hinges for wide-flange shapes bent about their major axis, and for rectangular shapes and symmetric box-section beams, respectively. These equations are a modified version of those appearing in the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b), which were based on research reported by Yura et al. (1978) and others. The intent of these equations is to establish a minimum rotation capacity,  $ R_{cap} \geq 3 $ , where  $ R_{cap} $  is defined as shown in Figure C-A-1.2.

Equations A-1-5 and A-1-7 have been modified to account for nonlinear moment diagrams and for situations in which a plastic hinge does not develop at the brace location corresponding to the larger end moment. The moment  $ M_{2} $  in these equations is the larger moment at the end of the unbraced length, taken as positive in all cases. The moment  $ M_{1}^{\prime} $  is the moment at the opposite end of the unbraced length corresponding to an equivalent linear moment diagram that gives the same target rotation capacity. This equivalent linear moment diagram is defined as follows:

(a) For cases in which the magnitude of the bending moment at any location within the unbraced length,  $ M_{max} $ , exceeds  $ M_{2} $ , the equivalent linear moment diagram is taken as a uniform moment diagram with a value equal to  $ M_{max} $  as illustrated in Figure C-A-1.3(a). Because the equivalent moment diagram is uniform, the appropriate value for  $ L_{pd} $  can be obtained by using  $ M_{1}^{\prime}/M_{2}=+1 $ .

(b) For cases in which the internal moment distribution along the unbraced length of the beam is indeed linear, or when a linear moment diagram between  $ M_{2} $  and the actual moment  $ M_{1} $  at the opposite end of the unbraced length gives a larger magnitude moment in the vicinity of  $ M_{2} $  as illustrated in Figure C-A-1.3(b),  $ M_{1}^{\prime} $  is taken as equal to the actual moment,  $ M_{1} $ .

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_22.md -->

(c) For all other cases in which the internal moment distribution along the unbraced length of the beam is nonlinear and a linear moment diagram between  $ M_{2} $  and the actual moment,  $ M_{1} $ , underestimates the moment in the vicinity of  $ M_{2} $ ,  $ M_{1}^{\prime} $  is defined as the opposite end moment for a line drawn between  $ M_{2} $  and the moment at the middle of the unbraced length,  $ M_{mid} $ , as illustrated in Figure C-A-1.3(c).

The moments  $ M_{1} $  and  $ M_{mid} $  are individually taken as positive when they cause compression in the same flange as the moment  $ M_{2} $ , and negative, otherwise.

For conditions in which lateral-torsional buckling cannot occur, such as members with square and round compact cross sections and doubly symmetric compact sections subjected to minor-axis bending or sufficient tension, the ductility of the member is not a factor of the unbraced length.

### 2 d. Axial Force

The provision in this section restricts the axial force in a compression member to  $ 0.75F_{y}A_{g} $  or approximately 80% of the design yield load,  $ \phi_{c}F_{y}A_{g} $ . This provision is a cautionary limitation, because insufficient research has been conducted to confirm that sufficient inelastic rotation capacity remains in members subjected to high levels of axial force.

### 3. Analysis Requirements

For all structural systems with members subjected to axial force, the equations of equilibrium must be formulated on the geometry of the deformed structure. The use of second-order inelastic analysis to determine load effects on members and connections is discussed in the Guide to Stability Design Criteria for Metal Structures (Ziemian, 2010). Textbooks (Chen and Lui, 1991; Chen and Sohal, 1995; and McGuire et al., 2000) present basic approaches to inelastic analysis, as well as worked examples and computer software for detailed study of the subject.

Continuous and properly braced beams not subjected to axial loads can be designed by first-order inelastic analysis (traditional plastic analysis and design). First-order plastic analysis is treated in ASCE (1971), in steel design textbooks (Salmon et al., 2008), and in textbooks dedicated entirely to plastic design (Beedle, 1958; Horne and Morris, 1982; Bruneau et al., 2011; Wong, 2009). Tools for plastic analysis of continuous beams are readily available to the designer from these and other books that provide simple ways of calculating plastic mechanism loads. It is important to note that such methods use LRFD load combinations, either directly or implicitly, and, therefore, should be modified to include a reduction in the plastic moment capacity of all members by a factor of 0.9. First-order inelastic analysis may also be used in the design of continuous steel-concrete composite beams. Design limits and ductility criteria for both the positive and negative plastic moments are given by Oehlers and Bradford (1995).

### 3 a. Material Properties and Yield Criteria

This section provides an accepted method for including uncertainty in system, member, and connection strength and stiffness. The reduction in yield strength and member stiffness is equivalent to the reduction of member strength associated with

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_23.md -->

the AISC resistance factors used in elastic design. In particular, the factor of 0.9 is based on the member and component resistance factors of Chapters E and F, which are appropriate when the structural system is composed of a single member and in cases where the system resistance depends critically on the resistance of a single member. For systems where this is not the case, the use of such a factor is conservative. The reduction in stiffness will contribute to larger deformations, and, in turn, increased second-order effects.

The inelastic behavior of most structural members is primarily the result of normal stresses in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the member equaling the yield strength of the material. Therefore, the normal stresses produced by the axial force and major- and minor-axis bending moments should be included in defining the plastic strength of member cross sections (Chen and Atsuta, 1976). Modeling of strain hardening that results in strengths greater than the plastic strength of the cross section is not permitted.

### 3 b. Geometric Imperfections

Because initial geometric imperfections may affect the nonlinear behavior of a structural system, it is imperative that they be included in the second-order analysis. Discussion on how frame out-of-plumbness may be modeled is provided in Commentary Section C2.2. Additional information is provided in ECCS (1984), Bridge and Bizzanelli (1997), Bridge (1998), and Ziemian (2010).

Member out-of-straightness should be included in situations in which it can have a significant impact on the inelastic behavior of the structural system. The significance of such effects is a function of (1) the relative magnitude of the member's applied axial force and bending moments, (2) whether the member is subjected to single or reverse curvature bending, and (3) the slenderness of the member.

In all cases, initial geometric imperfections should be modeled to represent the potential maximum destabilizing effects.

### 3 c. Residual Stresses and Partial Yielding Effects

Depending on the ratio of a member's plastic section modulus, Z, to its elastic section modulus, S, the partial yielding that occurs before the formation of a plastic hinge may significantly reduce the flexural stiffness of the member. This is particularly the case for minor-axis bending of I-shapes. Any change to bending stiffness may result in force redistribution and increased second-order effects, and thus needs to be considered in the inelastic analysis.

The impact of partial yielding is further accentuated by the presence of thermal residual stresses, which are due to nonuniform cooling during the manufacturing and fabrication processes. Because the relative magnitude and distribution of these stresses is dependent on the process and the cross-section geometry of the member, it is not possible to specify a single idealized pattern for use in all levels of inelastic analysis. Residual stress distributions used for common hot-rolled doubly symmetric shapes are provided in the literature, including ECCS (1984) and Ziemian (2010). In most cases, the maximum compressive residual stress is 30 to 50% of the yield stress.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_24.md -->

The effects of partial yielding and residual stresses may either be included directly in inelastic distributed-plasticity analyses or by modifying plastic hinge based methods of analysis. An example of the latter is provided by Ziemian and McGuire (2002) and Ziemian et al. (2008), in which the flexural stiffnesses of members are reduced according to the amount of axial force and major- and minor-axis bending moments being resisted. This Specification permits the use of a similar strategy, which is provided in Section C2.3 and described in the Commentary to that section. If the residual stress effect is not included in the analysis and the provisions of Section C2.3 are employed, the stiffness reduction factor of 0.9 specified in Appendix 1, Section 1.3.3a (which accounts for uncertainty in strength and stiffness) must be changed to 0.8. The reason for this is that the provisions given in Section C2.3 assume that the analysis does not account for partial yielding. Also, to avoid cases in which the use of Section C2.3 may be unconservative, it is further required that the yield or plastic hinge criterion used in the inelastic analysis be defined by the interaction Equations H1-1a and H1-1b. This condition on cross-section strength does not have to be met when the residual stress and partial yielding effects are accounted for in the analysis.

# APPENDIX 2

# DESIGN OF FILLED COMPOSITE MEMBERS   (HIGH STRENGTH)

Appendix 2 includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) The former content of Appendix 2, Design for Ponding, has been removed from the Specification and the ponding provisions in Section B3.10 and its Commentary have been expanded.

(2) This new appendix addresses rectangular filled composite members with high-strength materials above that specified in Chapter I.

#### 2.1. RECTANGULAR FILLED COMPOSITE MEMBERS

### 1. Limitations

Lai and Varma (2018) and Alghossoon and Varma (2020) evaluated the behavior of rectangular filled composite members constructed from steel and/or concrete with strengths above the limits given in Section I1.3. The range of parameters included by Lai and Varma (2018) were used to define the limitations of this section. At the boundary of material strength transitions, the equations provided in this appendix are moderately conservative for members made from normal strength materials.

### 2. Compressive Strength

The detailed parametric studies conducted by Lai and Varma (2018) were used to develop Equations A-2-1 and A-2-2. These equations account for the effects of local buckling of the compression steel elements on the available compressive strength of the rectangular filled composite members.

### 4. Combined Flexure and Axial Force

Equations A-2-3 and A-2-4 represent the axial compressive load-bending moment  $ (P-M) $  interaction behavior of rectangular filled composite members (Alghossoon and Varma, 2020). This P-M interaction can be used along with the direct analysis method for designing structures with such members.

# APPENDIX 3

# FATIGUE

Appendix 3 includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) Clarified hole forming provisions for elements subject to fatigue

(2) Replaced the list of differences compared to the RCSC Specification related to fatigue and put an illustrative list in the commentary

(3) Corrected the categories for attachments

(4) Added production methods for small radius cuts in elements

When the limit state of fatigue is a design consideration, its severity is most significantly affected by the number of load applications, the magnitude of the stress range, and the severity of the stress concentrations associated with particular details. Issues of fatigue are not normally encountered in building design; however, when encountered and if the severity is great enough, fatigue is of concern and all provisions of this appendix must be satisfied.

The determination of fatigue resistance for galvanized components is not explicitly addressed in this appendix.

#### 3.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

This appendix deals with high-cycle fatigue (i.e., >20,000 cycles); this behavior occurs when elastic stresses are involved. In situations where inelastic (plastic) stresses are involved, fatigue cracks may initiate at far fewer than 20,000 cycles—perhaps as few as a dozen. However, unlike the conditions prescribed in this appendix, low-cycle fatigue involves cyclic, inelastic stresses; this is because the applicable cyclic allowable stress range will be limited by the static allowable stress. At low levels of cyclic tensile stress, a point is reached where the stress range is so low that fatigue cracking will not initiate regardless of the number of cycles of loading. This level of stress is defined as the fatigue threshold,  $ F_{TH} $ .

Extensive test programs using full-size specimens, substantiated by theoretical stress analysis, have confirmed the following general conclusions (Fisher et al., 1970; Fisher et al., 1974):

(a) Stress range and notch severity are the dominant stress variables for welded details and beams.

(b) Other variables such as minimum stress, mean stress, and maximum stress are not significant for design purposes.

(c) Structural steels with a specified minimum yield stress of 36 to 100 ksi (250 to 690 MPa) do not exhibit significantly different fatigue strengths for given welded details fabricated in the same manner.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_27.md -->

Fatigue crack growth rates are generally inversely proportional to the modulus of elasticity, and therefore, at higher temperatures, crack growth rates increase. At  $ 500^{\circ} $ F ( $ 260^{\circ} $ C), crack growth rates on ASTM A212B steel (ASTM, 1967) are essentially the same as for room temperature (Hertzberg et al., 2012). The appendix is conservatively limited to applications involving temperatures not to exceed  $ 300^{\circ} $ F ( $ 150^{\circ} $ C). Elevated temperature applications may also have corrosion effects that are not considered by the appendix.

The appendix does not have a lower temperature limit because fatigue crack growth rates are lower. Fatigue tests as low as  $ -100^{\circ}F $  ( $ -75^{\circ}C $ ) have been conducted with no observed change in crack growth rates (Roberts et al., 1980). It should be recognized that at low temperatures, brittle fracture concerns increase. The critical size to which a crack can grow before the onset of brittle fracture will be smaller for low-temperature applications than will be the case for a room-temperature application.

#### 3.2. CALCULATION OF MAXIMUM STRESSES AND STRESS RANGES

Fluctuation in stress that does not involve tensile stress does not cause crack propagation and is not considered to be a fatigue situation. On the other hand, in elements of members subject solely to calculated compressive stress, fatigue cracks may initiate in regions of high tensile residual stress. In such situations, the cracks generally do not propagate beyond the region of the residual tensile stress, because the residual stress is relieved by the crack. For this reason, stress ranges that are completely in compression need not be investigated for fatigue. For cases involving cyclic reversal of stress, the calculated stress range must be taken as the sum of the compressive stress and the tensile stress caused by different directions or patterns of the applied live load. When part of the stress cycle is compressive, the stress range may exceed  $ 0.66F_{y} $ .

#### 3.3. PLAIN MATERIAL AND WELDED JOINTS

Fatigue resistance has been derived from an exponential relationship between the number of cycles to failure, N, and the stress range,  $ S_{r} $ , called an S-N relationship, of the form

 $$ N=\frac{C_{f}}{S_{r}^{n}} $$ 

The general relationship is often plotted as a linear log-log function ( $ \log N = A - n \log S_{r} $ ). Figure C-A-3.1 shows the family of fatigue resistance curves identified as stress categories A, B, B', C, D, E, E', and G. These relationships were established based on an extensive database developed in the United States and abroad (Keating and Fisher, 1986). The allowable stress range has been developed by adjusting the coefficient,  $ C_{f} $ , so that a design curve is provided that lies two standard deviations of the standard error of estimate of the fatigue cycle life below the mean S-N relationship of the actual test data. These values of  $ C_{f} $  correspond to a probability of failure of 2.5% of the design life.

The number of stress range fluctuations in a design life,  $ n_{SR} $ , in Equation A-3-1, can often be calculated as

 $$ \begin{aligned}n_{SR}=&\left(number of stress fluctuations per day\right)\\&\times\left(365days\right)\times\left(years in design life\right)\end{aligned} $$ 

 $$  Specification for Structural Steel Buildings,August1,2022 $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_28.md -->

Stress category F is shown in Figure C-A-3.2 and has a slope different than the other stress categories. The fatigue resistance of stress category  $ C' $  or  $ C'' $  details is determined by applying a reduction factor,  $ R_{PJP} $  or  $ R_{FIL} $ , respectively, to the stress category C stress range, which shifts the fatigue resistance curve for stress category C downward by a factor proportional to the reduction. Unlike stress category C, stress category  $ C' $  and  $ C'' $  details do not have a fatigue threshold.

Prior to the 1999 AISC Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2000b), stepwise tables meeting the criteria discussed in the foregoing, including cycles of loading, stress categories, and allowable stress ranges were provided in the Specification. A single table format (Table A-3.1) was

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_22_img_in_chart_box_157_369_703_758.jpg" ></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, August 1, 2022 AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_22/doc_29.md -->

introduced in the 1999 AISC LRFD Specification that provides the stress categories, ingredients for the applicable equation, and information and examples, including the sites of concern for potential crack initiation (AISC, 2000b).

Table A-3.1 is organized into eight sections of general conditions for fatigue design, as follows:

(1) Section 1 provides information and examples for the steel material at copes, holes, cutouts, or as produced.

(2) Section 2 provides information and examples for various types of mechanically fastened joints, including eyebars and pin plates.

(3) Section 3 provides information related to welded connections used to join built-up members, such as longitudinal welds, access holes, and reinforcements.

(4) Section 4 deals only with longitudinal load-carrying fillet welds at shear splices.

(5) Section 5 provides information for various types of groove- and fillet-welded joints that are transverse to the applied cyclic stress.

(6) Section 6 provides information on a variety of groove-welded attachments to flange tips and web plates, as well as similar attachments, connected with either fillet or partial-joint-penetration groove welds.

(7) Section 7 provides information on several short attachments to structural members.

(8) Section 8 collects several miscellaneous details, such as shear connectors, shear on the throat of fillet, plug, and slot welds, and their impact on base metal. It also provides for tension on the stress area of various bolts, threaded anchor rods, and hangers.

A similar format and consistent criteria are used by other specifications.

When fabrication details involving more than one stress category occur at the same location in a member, the stress range at that location must be limited to that of the most restrictive category. The need for a member larger than required by static loading will often be eliminated by locating notch-producing fabrication details in regions subjected to smaller ranges of stress.

A detail not explicitly covered before 1989 (AISC, 1989) was added in the 1999 AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b) to cover tension-loaded plate elements connected at their end by transverse partial-joint-penetration groove or fillet welds in which there is more than a single site for the initiation of fatigue cracking, one of which will be more critical than the others depending upon welded joint type and size, and material thickness (Frank and Fisher, 1979). Regardless of the site within the joint at which potential crack initiation is considered, the allowable stress range provided is applicable to connected material at the toe of the weld.

#### 3.4. BOLTS AND THREADED PARTS

Bolts, bolted joints, and threaded parts can be subjected to cyclic forces in shear, tension, or some combination of the two. This section addresses the fatigue resistance of bolts and threaded parts subject to cyclic tension and the fatigue resistance of connected parts subjected to cyclic shear. This section does not address the combined

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_0.md -->

effect of cyclic shear and tension on the fatigue resistance of bolts, bolted joints, and threaded parts. The fatigue resistance of bolts used in joints subjected to cyclic shear will not govern the fatigue life of conditions considered and permitted (pretensioned joints) in Appendix 3.

The fatigue resistance of connected parts in mechanically fastened joints subjected to cyclic tension is not addressed in Appendix 3. The fatigue resistance of connected parts in mechanically fastened joints subjected to cyclic tension will generally not govern the fatigue life of conditions commonly encountered in structural steel buildings. Unusual conditions may be encountered for which the fatigue resistance of the connected parts in mechanically fastened joints subjected to cyclic tension will govern the fatigue life.

There are many examples where fatigue cracking is the consequence of out-of-plane deformations. This is referred to as displacement-induced fatigue cracking. Elimination of displacement-induced fatigue cracking is largely a matter of good detailing, which is a difficult thing to quantify.

Satisfying the requirements for force-induced fatigue design does not eliminate the need to examine the possibility of distortion-induced fatigue cracking.

Bolted Connections Subjected to Cyclic Shear Forces. This Specification does not address the use of nonpretensioned fasteners for joints subjected to cyclic shear forces.

The fatigue strength of a bolted shear splice is directly influenced by the type of load transfer in the connection. This load transfer can be completely by friction (slip-critical) at the interface of the connected parts, completely by bearing of the bolts against the connected material, or by some combination of these two mechanisms. In the case where the load transfer is by friction, fretting of the connected parts occurs, particularly on the faying surfaces near the extremities of the joint. Cracks are initiated and grow in this region, which means that cracking takes place ahead of the first (or last) bolt hole in a line, and the crack progresses through the gross cross section of the component. If the connection is not designed as slip-critical, the load should be assumed to be transferred entirely by shear in the fasteners and an equilibrating bearing force in the connected parts. The local tensile stress in the region of the connected part adjacent to the hole is high, and this is now the location where fatigue cracks can start and grow through the net cross section of the connected part. Both types of fatigue crack behavior have been observed in laboratory tests and, in a few cases, both types have been observed within the same test. It is worth noting that there is no history of fatigue failure of high-strength bolts themselves in shear splices; only the connected material is susceptible to fatigue cracking.

Bolted Connections Subjected to Cyclic Tensile Forces. The RCSC Specification for Structural Joints Using High-Strength Bolts (RCSC, 2022), hereafter referred to as the RCSC Specification, requires that bolted joints subjected to tensile fatigue be pretensioned. In pretensioned joints, deformation of the connected parts resulting from the applied tension introduces prying action, the magnitude of which is not completely predictable (Kulak et al., 1987). The effect of prying is not limited to a change in the average axial tension on the bolt but also includes bending in

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_1.md -->

the threaded area under the nut. Because of the uncertainties in calculating prying effects, definitive provisions for the allowable stress range for bolts subjected to applied axial tension are not included in this Specification. To limit the uncertainties regarding prying action on the fatigue of pretensioned bolts in details that introduce prying, the allowable stress range provided in Table A-3.1 is appropriate for extended cyclic loading only if the prying induced by the applied load is small.

The tensile stress range of bolts that are pretensioned to the requirements of Table J3.1 or J3.1M can be conservatively approximated as 20% of the absolute value of the applied cyclic axial load and moment from dead, live, and other loads. AISC Design Guide 17, High Strength Bolts: A Primer for Structural Engineers (Kulak, 2002), states that the final bolt force is the initial pretension force plus a component of the externally applied load that depends on the relative area of the bolts and the area of the connected material in compression. Test results show that this approach is a good predictor and that the increase in bolt pretension can be expected to be on the order of not more than about 5 to 10%, which affirms that the 20% rule is a conservative upper bound. The approximated stress range is compared with the allowable and threshold stress range.

The prying force,  $ q_{r} $ , determined in Part 9 of the AISC Steel Construction Manual (AISC, 2017) is based on a model that considers only equilibrium, and does not produce an estimate of the prying effect adequate for determination of fatigue resistance. See A Fatigue Primer for Structural Engineers (Fisher et al., 1998) and Chapter 7 of AISC Design Guide 17 (Kulak, 2002), for more information.

Fatigue provisions in Appendix 3 and in the RCSC Specification are applied differently, but produce similar results. Some key differences are as follows:

(a) Appendix 3 is a stress range applied using a bolt net tension area, where RCSC Specification Table 5.3 is a maximum stress applied based upon the cross-sectional area determined from the nominal diameter.

(b) Appendix 3 is applied by determining a maximum allowable stress range and a stress range threshold regardless of the bolt material, where RCSC Specification Table 5.3 is applied by determining a maximum bolt stress, which does depend on the bolt material; therefore, the stresses obtained from Appendix 3 should be compared to the tensile stress range including prying, while the stresses obtained from RCSC Specification Table 5.3 should be compared to the total applied tensile stress including prying. The total bolt force may be estimated as recommended by Kulak et al. (1987).

The fatigue provisions in Appendix 3, not those in the RCSC Specification, should be used when this Specification must be satisfied.

Threaded Parts Subjected to Cyclic Tensile Forces. In addition to addressing high-strength bolted joints, which must be pretensioned when subject to tensile fatigue, Appendix 3 also addresses threaded parts subject to tensile fatigue that may not be pretensioned. Examples of such conditions include threaded anchor rods, threaded rod hangers, and threaded rod bracing. Common bolts, which cannot be effectively pretensioned, are not addressed in the RCSC Specification. Common bolts (ASTM A307) are approved for use under this Specification and may be subject to tensile

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_2.md -->

fatigue. However, bolted joints with only steel within the grip subject to tensile fatigue should employ high-strength bolts and therefore should be pretensioned.

The fatigue resistance of threaded parts subjected to tension is predictable in the absence of pretension and prying action because the stress range is directly and solely related to the applied tension. In pretensioned joints, much of the applied tension reduces the clamping force between the plies and only a small portion (permitted to be conservatively taken as 20% of the applied load) is reflected in the stress range. In non-pretensioned joints, the stress range includes the entire combined effect of the applied tension and prying action. Consequently, the fatigue resistance of nonpretensioned threaded parts subjected to cyclic tensile forces is greatly reduced. High stress ranges combined with an unfavorable stress category, G, may result in impractical designs.

#### 3.5. FABRICATION AND ERECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR FATIGUE

It is essential that when longitudinal backing bars are left in place, they are continuous or spliced using flush-ground complete-joint-penetration groove welds before attachment to the parts being joined. Otherwise, the transverse nonfused section constitutes a crack-like defect that can lead to premature fatigue failure or even brittle fracture of the built-up member.

Welds that attach left-in-place longitudinal backing to the structural member will affect the fatigue performance of the structural member. Continuous longitudinal fillet welds are stress category B; intermittent fillet welds are stress category E. Longitudinal backing may be attached to the joint by tack welding in the groove, attaching the backing to one member with a fillet weld, or attaching the backing to both members with fillet welds.

The use of weld tabs at transverse butt-joint groove welds enhances weld soundness at the ends of the joint. Subsequent removal of the tabs and grinding of the ends flush with the edge of the member removes discontinuities that may be detrimental to fatigue resistance.

In transversely loaded T-joints subjected to tension, a lack-of-fusion plane between the steel backing and the flange of the T acts as an initial crack-like condition. In groove welds, the root at the backing bar can have discontinuities that can reduce the fatigue resistance of the connection. Removing the backing, back gouging to sound metal, and rewelding eliminates the lack of fusion plane and undesirable discontinuities. Also, attachments with no transition result in abrupt changes in stiffness of the stressed member corresponding to the stress the attachment attracts from the main member. Longer and thicker attachments attract more stress and make the connection of the attachment stiffer. These stiffness changes act as stress concentrations that limit the ability of the main member to resist and aggravate fatigue cracking growth.

The addition of contoured fillet welds at transverse complete-joint-penetration groove welds in T- and corner-joints and at reentrant corners reduces the stress concentration and improves fatigue resistance.

Experimental studies on welded built-up beams demonstrated that if the surface roughness of flame-cut edges was less than  $ 1,000 \mu $ in. ( $ 25 \mu $ m), fatigue cracks would

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_3.md -->

not develop from the flame-cut edge but from the longitudinal fillet welds connecting the beam flanges to the web (Fisher et al., 1970, 1974). This provides stress category B fatigue resistance without the necessity for grinding flame-cut edges.

Reentrant corners at cuts, copes, and weld access holes provide a stress concentration point that can reduce fatigue resistance. Discontinuities introduced by punching or thermal cutting also reduce fatigue resistance. The stress ranges allowing for a detail with a radius of  $ R \geq 1 $  in. (25 mm) require reaming subpunched holes and grinding thermally cut surfaces to bright metal to eliminate the effects of notches on the surface of the radius. The limited stress range permitted for details with a radius  $ \geq \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm) allow for these surfaces to be left in the as-produced condition for punched or thermally cut holes. Reaming surfaces with small radii dimensions is difficult.

For Cases 1.4, 1.5, and 3.3 in Table A-3.1, Yam and Cheng (1990) reported that fatigue performance of reentrant corners less than 1 in. and not ground smooth is similar to stress category C when calculated with a stress concentration factor. To be consistent with other cases in this appendix, reentrant corners with radii as small as  $ \frac{3}{8} $  in. (10 mm) and not ground are assigned stress category E' and do not have to be calculated with a stress concentration factor. Reentrant corners with a radius of at least 1 in. (25 mm) and meeting surface requirements and NDE requirements are associated with stress category C, except for built-up members, where it is stress category D.

For Cases 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 in Table A-3.1, coverplates and other attachments wider than the flange with welds across the ends are subject to fatigue stress categories E and E', depending on the thickness of the flange. There has been little research on connections with coverplates that are wider than the flange, where the flange is thicker than 0.8 in. (20 mm) and without welds across the ends; therefore, this detail is not permitted, as indicated for Case 3.7. Cover-plated flanges thicker than 0.8 in. (20 mm) are permitted when the ends are welded.

As shown in Case 7.1 in Table A-3.1, base metal subjected to longitudinal loading at details with parallel or transverse welds with no transition radius is subject to stress category C, D, E, or E' fatigue stresses, depending on the length and thickness of the attachment. Attachments with no transition result in abrupt changes in stiffness of the stressed member corresponding to the stress the attachment attracts from the main member. Larger attachments attract more stress and make the attachment connection stiffer. These stiffness changes act as stress concentrations and aggravate fatigue crack growth. The geometric limits of the attachments at the threshold of each category were rewritten in 2022 to clarify their application.

The use of run-off tabs at transverse butt-joint groove welds enhances weld soundness at the ends of the joint. Subsequent removal of the tabs and grinding of the ends flush with the edge of the member removes discontinuities that are detrimental to fatigue resistance.

• ASCE/SEI/SFPE 29-05, Standard Calculation Methods for Structural Fire Protection (ASCE, 2005)

• 2005 Eurocode 3: Design of Steel Structures; Part 1.2: General Rules, Structural Fire Design (CEN, 2005b)

#### 4.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Appendix 4 provides structural engineers with criteria for designing steel-framed building systems and components, including columns, and floor and truss assemblies, for fire conditions. Compliance with the performance objective in Section 4.1.1 can be demonstrated by either structural analysis or component qualification testing.

Thermal expansion and progressive decrease in strength and stiffness are the primary structural responses to elevated temperatures that may occur during fires. An assessment of a design of building components and systems based on structural mechanics that allows designers to address the fire-induced restrained thermal expansions, deformations, and material degradation at elevated temperatures can lead to a more robust structural design for fire conditions.

### 1. Performance Objective

The performance objective underlying the provisions in this Specification is that of life safety. Fire safety levels should depend on the building occupancy, height of the building, the presence of active fire mitigation measures, and the effectiveness of firefighting. Three limit states exist for elements serving as fire barriers (compartment walls and floors): (1) heat transmission leading to unacceptable rise of temperature on the unexposed surface; (2) breach of barrier due to cracking or loss of integrity; and (3) loss of load-bearing capacity. In general, all three must be considered by the engineer to achieve the desired performance. These three limit states are interrelated in fire-resistant design. For structural elements that are not part of a fire barrier, the governing limit state is loss of load-bearing capacity.

Specific performance objectives for a facility are determined by the stakeholders in the building process, within the context of the general performance objective and limit states discussed in the preceding paragraph. In some instances, applicable building codes may stipulate that steel in buildings of certain occupancies and heights be protected by fire-resistant materials or assemblies to achieve specified performance goals.

### 2. Design by Engineering Analysis

The strength design criteria for steel beams and columns at elevated temperatures are based on Tagaki and Deierlein (2007). These strength equations do not transition smoothly to the strength equations used to design steel members under ambient conditions. The practical implications of the discontinuity are minor, as the temperatures in the structural members during a fully developed fire are far in excess of the temperatures at which this discontinuity might otherwise be of concern in design.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_6.md -->

Nevertheless, to avoid the possibility of misinterpretation, the scope of applicability of the analysis methods in Appendix 4, Section 4.2, is limited to temperatures above  $ 400^{\circ} $ F ( $ 200^{\circ} $ C).

Structural behavior under severe fire conditions is highly nonlinear in nature as a result of the constitutive behavior of materials at elevated temperatures and the relatively large deformations that may develop in structural systems at sustained elevated temperatures. As a result of this behavior, it is difficult to develop design equations to establish the necessary level of structural performance during severe fires using elastically based ASD methods. Accordingly, structural design for fire conditions by analysis should be performed using LRFD methods, in which the nonlinear structural actions arising during severe fire exposures and the temperature-dependent design strengths can be properly taken into account.

### 4. Load Combinations and Required Strength

Fire safety measures are aimed at three levels of performance: (1) to prevent the outbreak of fires through elimination of ignition sources or hazardous practices; (2) to prevent uncontrolled fire development and flashover through early detection and suppression; and (3) to prevent loss of life or structural collapse through fire-protection systems, compartmentation, exit ways, and provision of general structural integrity and other passive measures. Specific structural design provisions to check structural integrity and risk of progressive failure due to severe fires can be developed from principles of structural reliability theory (Ellingwood and Leyendecker, 1978; Ellingwood and Corotis, 1991).

The limit state probability of failure due to fire can be written as

 $$ P(F)=P(F|D,I)P(D|I)P(I) $$ 

where

 $$ P(I)\qquad=\mathrm{p r o b a b i l i t y~o f~i g n i t i o n} $$ 

 $$ P(D|I)\quad=probability of development of a structurally significant fire $$ 

 $ P(F|D,I) = \text{probability of failure, given the occurrence of the two preceding events} $ 

Measures taken to reduce  $ P(I) $  and  $ P(D|I) $  are mainly nonstructural in nature. Measures taken by the structural engineer to design fire resistance into the structure impact the term  $ P(F|D,I) $ .

The development of structural design requirements requires a target reliability index, reliability being measured by  $ P(F) $  from Equation C-A-4-1. Analysis of reliability of structural systems for gravity dead and live load (Galambos et al., 1982) suggests that the limit state probability of individual steel members and connections is on the order of  $ 10^{-5} $  to  $ 10^{-4} $  per year. For redundant steel frame systems,  $ P(F) $  is on the order of  $ 10^{-6} $  to  $ 10^{-5} $ . The de minimis risk, that is, the level below which the risk is of regulatory or legal concern and the economic or social benefits of risk reduction are small, is on the order of  $ 10^{-7} $  to  $ 10^{-6} $  per year (Pate-Cornell, 1994). If  $ P(I) $  is on the order of  $ 10^{-4} $  per year for typical buildings and  $ P(D|I) $  is on the order of  $ 10^{-2} $  for office or commercial buildings in urban areas with suppression systems or other protective measures, then  $ P(F|D,I) $  should be approximately 0.1 to ascertain that the risk due to structural failure caused by fire is socially acceptable.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_7.md -->

The use of first-order structural reliability analysis based on this target (conditional) limit state probability leads to the gravity load combination presented as Equation A-4-1. Load combination Equation A-4-1 is similar to Equation 2.5-1 that appears in ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022), where the probabilistic basis for load combinations for extraordinary events is explained in detail. The factor 0.9 is applied to the dead load when the effect of the dead load is to stabilize the structure; otherwise, the factor 1.2 is applied. The companion action load factors on L and S in that equation reflect the fact that the probability of a coincidence of the peak time-varying load with the occurrence of a fire is negligible (Ellingwood and Corotis, 1991).

The overall stability of the structural system is checked by considering the effect of a small notional lateral load equal to 0.2% of the story gravity load, as defined in Section C2.2, acting in combination with the gravity loads. The required strength of the structural component or system, designed using the load combination given by Equation A-4-1, is on the order of 60 to 70% of the required strength under full gravity or wind load at normal temperature.

#### 4.2. STRUCTURAL DESIGN FOR FIRE CONDITIONS BY ANALYSIS

### 1. Design-Basis Fire

Once a fuel load has been agreed upon for the occupancy, the designer should demonstrate the effect of various fires on the structure by assessing the temperature-time relationships for various ventilation factors. NFPA 557 (NFPA, 2020b) and SFPE S.01 (SFPE, 2011), as well as other published standards, can be consulted in this regard. These heating effects may result in different structural responses, and it is useful to demonstrate the capability of the structure to withstand such exposures. The effects of a localized fire should also be assessed to ascertain that local damage is not excessive. Based on these results, members, connections, and edge details can be specified to provide a structure that is sufficiently robust.

### 1 a. Localized Fire

Localized fires may occur in large open spaces, such as the pedestrian area of covered malls, concourses of airport terminals, warehouses, and factories, where fuel packages are separated by large aisles or open spaces. In such cases, the radiant heat flux can be estimated by a point source approximation, requiring the heat release rate of the fire and separation distance between the center of the fuel package and the closest surface of the steelwork. The heat release rate can be determined from experimental results or may be estimated if the mass loss rate per unit floor area occupied by the fuel is known; otherwise, a steady-state fire may be assumed.

### 1 b. Post-Flashover Compartment Fires

Caution should be exercised when determining temperature-time profiles for spaces with high aspect ratios, for example, 5:1 or greater, or for large spaces, for example, those with an open (or exposed) floor area in excess of  $ 5,000 \, ft^{2} $  ( $ 460 \, m^{2} $ ). In such cases, it is unlikely that all combustibles will burn in the space simultaneously. Instead, burning will be most intense in, or perhaps limited to, the combustibles.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_8.md -->

nearest to a ventilation source. For modest-sized compartments with low aspect ratios, the temperature history of the design fire can be determined by algebraic equations or computer models, such as those described in the SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering (SFPE, 2002) or Eurocode Model Code on Fire Engineering (ECCS, 2001).

Caution should be exercised when determining the fire duration for spaces with high aspect ratios, for example, 5:1 or greater, or for large spaces, for example, those with a floor area in excess of  $ 5,000 \, ft^{2} $  ( $ 460 \, m^{2} $ ). The principal difficulty lies in obtaining a realistic estimate for the mass loss rate, given that all combustibles within the space may not be burning simultaneously. Failure to recognize uneven burning will result in an overestimation of the mass burning rate and an underestimation of the fire duration by a significant margin. Note: Some computation methods may implicitly determine the duration of the fire, in which case, the calculation of mass loss rate is unnecessary.

Where a parametric curve is used to define a post-flashover fire, the duration is determined by means of the fuel versus ventilation provisions, not explicitly by loss of mass. This clause should not limit the use of temperature-time relationships to those where duration is calculated, as stated in the foregoing, as these tend to be localized fires and external fire.

### 1 c. Exterior Fires

A design guide is available for determining the exposure resulting from an exterior fire (AISI, 1979).

### 1 d. Active Fire-Protection Systems

Due consideration should be given to the reliability and effectiveness of active fire-protection systems when describing the design-basis fire. When an automatic sprinkler system is installed, the total fuel load may be reduced by up to 60% based on Eurocode 1 (CEN, 1991). The maximum reduction in the fuel load should be considered only when the automatic sprinkler system is considered to be of the highest reliability; for example, reliable and adequate water supply, supervision of control valves, regular schedule for maintenance of the automatic sprinkler system developed in accordance with NFPA (2020a), or alterations of the automatic sprinkler system are considered any time alterations for the space are considered.

For spaces with automatic smoke and heat vents, computer models are available to determine the smoke temperature (SFPE, 2002). Reduction in the temperature profile because of smoke and heat vents should only be considered for reliable installations of smoke and heat vents. Therefore, a regular maintenance schedule for the vents needs to be established in accordance with NFPA (2021a).

### 2. Temperatures in Structural Systems Under Fire Conditions

The heat transfer analysis may range from lumped analyses, where the structural member is assumed to be at uniform temperature, to three-dimensional analyses. The uniform temperature assumption is appropriate in a “lumped heat capacity analysis”

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_9.md -->

where a steel column, beam, or truss element is uniformly heated along the entire length and around the entire perimeter of the exposed section and the protection system is uniform along the entire length and around the entire perimeter of the section. In cases with nonuniform heating or where different protection methods are used on different sides of the column, a two-dimensional analysis should be conducted for steel column assemblies. Two-dimensional analyses are also appropriate for beams, bar joists, or truss elements supporting floor or roof slabs. In the case of composite plate shear walls with uniform heating along the width, a one-dimensional analysis can be conducted per unit width of the wall. A two-dimensional or three-dimensional analysis may be required for composite plate shear wall systems with nonuniform heating or with special configurations or boundary conditions.

Heat transfer analyses should consider changes in material properties with increasing temperature for all materials included in the assembly. This may be done in the lumped heat capacity analysis using an effective property value, determined at a temperature near the estimated midpoint of the temperature range expected to be experienced by that component over the duration of the exposure. In the one-, two-, and three-dimensional analyses, the variation in properties with temperature should be explicitly included.

The boundary conditions for the heat transfer analysis should consider radiation heat transfer in all cases and convection heat transfer if the exposed element is submerged in the smoke or is being subjected to flame impingement. The presence of fire-resistive materials in the form of insulation, heat screens, or other protective measures should be taken into account, if appropriate.

Lumped Heat Capacity Analysis. This first-order analysis to predict the temperature rise of steel structural members can be conducted using algebraic equations iteratively. This approach assumes that the steel member has a uniform temperature, applicable to cases where the steel member is unprotected or uniformly protected on all sides, and is exposed to fire around the entire perimeter of the assembly containing the steel member. Caution should be used when applying this method to steel beams supporting floor and roof slabs, as the approach will overestimate the temperature rise in the beam. In addition, where this analysis is used as input for the structural analysis of a fire-exposed steel beam supporting a floor and roof slab, the thermally induced moments will not be simulated as a result of the uniform temperature assumption.

The fire temperature needs to be determined based on the results of the design fire analysis. As alternatives, the standard time-temperature curves indicated in ASTM E119 (ASTM, 2020d) for building fires or ASTM E1529 (ASTM, 2016) for petrochemical fires may be selected.

Unprotected Steel Members. The temperature rise in an unprotected steel section in a short time period is determined by

 $$ \Delta T_{s}=\frac{a}{c_{s}\left(\frac{W}{D}\right)}\left(T_{F}-T_{s}\right)\Delta t $$

For accuracy reasons, a maximum limit for the time step,  $ \Delta t $ , is suggested as 5 s.

Protected Steel Members. This method is most applicable for steel members with contour protection schemes, in other words, where the insulating (or protection) material follows the shape of the section. Application of this method for box protection methods will generally result in the temperature rise being overestimated. The approach assumes that the outside insulation temperature is approximately equal to the fire temperature. Alternatively, a more complex analysis may be conducted that determines the exterior insulation temperature from a heat transfer analysis between the assembly and the exposing fire environment.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_11.md -->

If the thermal capacity of the insulation is much less than that for the steel, such that the following inequality is satisfied:

 $$ c_{s}W/D>d_{p}\uprho_{p}c_{p}/72 $$ 

then, Equation C-A-4-6 can be applied to determine the temperature rise in the steel:

 $$ \Delta T_{s}=\frac{k_{p}}{c_{s}d_{p}\left(\frac{W}{D}\right)}\left(T_{F}-T_{s}\right)\Delta t $$ 

If the thermal capacity of the insulation needs to be considered (such that the inequality in Equation C-A-4-5 is not satisfied), then Equation C-A-4-7 should be applied:

 $$ \Delta T_{s}=\frac{k_{p}}{d_{p}}\left[\frac{T_{F}-T_{s}}{c_{s}\left(\frac{W}{D}\right)+\frac{c_{p}\uprho_{p}d_{p}}{288}}\right]\Delta t $$ 

where

 $ k_{p}= $  thermal conductivity of the fire-protection material, Btu/ft-sec- $ ^{\circ} $ F (W/m- $ ^{\circ} $ C)



ρp = density of the fire-protection material, lb/ft3 (kg/m3)

Note that the maximum limit for the time step,  $ \Delta t $ , should be 5 s.

Ideally, material properties used in Equations C-A-4-6 and C-A-4-7 should be considered as a function of temperature. Alternatively, characteristic material properties may be evaluated at a mid-range temperature expected for that component or from calibrations to test data. For protected steel members, the material properties may be evaluated at  $ 572^{\circ} $ F ( $ 300^{\circ} $ C), and for protection materials, a temperature of  $ 932^{\circ} $ F ( $ 500^{\circ} $ C) may be considered. ECCS (2001) and AISC Design Guide 19, Fire Resistance of Structural Steel Framing (Ruddy et al., 2003), provide suggestions for material properties of the protection material. A NIST report (Carino et al., 2005) provides protection material properties as a function of temperature.

External Steelwork. Temperature rise can be determined by applying the following equation:

 $$ \Delta T_{s}=\frac{q^{\prime \prime}}{c_{s}\left(\frac{W}{D}\right)}\Delta t $$ 

where

 $ q'' = net heat flux incident on the steel member, Btu/s-ft-in. (J/s-m^{2}) $ 

All given equations assume applications in consistent dimensional units within either the U.S. customary or SI systems. For Equations C-A-4-2, C-A-4-5, C-A-4-6, and C-A-4-7, the W/D in the U.S. customary system needs to be replaced by M/D for SI systems, where M is the mass per unit length. To convert W/D, typically given in lb/ft/in. to the appropriate M/D units of kg/m $ ^{2} $  in SI, multiply the lb/ft/in. value for W/D by 58.6.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_12.md -->

Advanced Calculation Methods. The thermal response of steel members may be assessed by application of a computer model. A computer model for analyzing the thermal response of the steel members should consider the following:

(a) Exposure conditions are established based on the definition of a design fire. The exposure conditions need to be stipulated either in terms of a time-temperature history, along with radiation and convection heat transfer parameters associated with the exposure, or as an incident heat flux. The incident heat flux is dependent on the design fire scenario and the location of the structural assembly. The heat flux emitted by the fire or smoke can be determined from a fire hazard analysis.

(b) Temperature-dependent material properties.

(c) Temperature variation within the steel member and any protection components, especially where the exposure varies from side to side.

### 3. Material Properties at Elevated Temperatures

The material properties used to assess the performance of steel and concrete structures at elevated temperatures should account for nonlinearities in stress versus strain response, thermal expansion, and time dependent creep effects. As these effects are highly variable, the uncertainties in the properties should be considered in measuring and using the derived properties to determine whether structural components and systems achieve the required reliability index target for deformation and strength limit states. While the Specification permits the determination of steel material properties from test data, in practice, this is challenging, given that there are no universally accepted test methods to consistently establish all of the required properties.

In lieu of test data on material properties, this Specification allows the use of properties for steel and concrete at elevated temperatures adopted from the ECCS Model Code on Fire Engineering (ECCS, 2001), Section III.2, "Material Properties." These generic properties are consistent with those in Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b) and Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2005d), and reflect the consensus of the international fire engineering and research community. Therefore, they are considered to implicitly incorporate the nonlinear stress versus strain response, including the effects of creep, as appropriate, for evaluating structural response of buildings under fires. The background information for the mechanical properties of structural steel at elevated temperatures can be found in Cooke (1988) and Kirby and Preston (1988).

The stress-strain response of steel at elevated temperatures is more nonlinear than at room temperature and experiences less strain hardening. At elevated temperatures, the deviation from linear behavior is represented by the proportional limit,  $ F_{p}(T) $ , and the yield strength,  $ F_{y}(T) $ , as defined at a 2% strain as shown in Figure C-A-4.1. At  $ 1,000^{\circ} $ F ( $ 540^{\circ} $ C), the yield strength,  $ F_{y}(T) $ , reduces to about 66% of its value at room temperature, and the proportional limit  $ F_{p}(T) $  occurs at 29% of the ambient temperature yield strength,  $ F_{y} $ . Finally, at temperatures above  $ 750^{\circ} $ F ( $ 400^{\circ} $ C), the elevated temperature ultimate strength is commonly the same as the elevated temperature yield strength; in other words,  $ F_{y}(T) $  is equal to  $ F_{u}(T) $ , which is a conservative assumption.

For cases where it is appropriate to include strain hardening for steel, the following equations may be used for temperatures below  $ 750^{\circ} $ F ( $ 400^{\circ} $ C) and strains beyond 2%. These equations are adopted from Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b), Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2005d), and the ECCS Model Code on Fire Engineering (ECCS, 2001), which stipulates that strain hardening should only be considered for advanced models where local instability is prevented. The specified minimum tensile strength at elevated temperatures with strain hardening may be calculated as follows:

(a) When  $ T < 572^{\circ}F $  ( $ 300^{\circ}C $ )

 $$ F_{u}(T)=1.25F_{y} $$ 

(b) When 572℉ (300℃) ≤ T ≤ 750℉ (400℃)

 $$ F_{u}(T)=F_{y}(2.05-0.0014T)for T in^{\circ}F $$ 

 $$ F_{u}(T)=F_{y}(2-0.0025T)for T in\text{℃} $$ 

(c) When  $ T \geq 750^{\circ}F $  ( $ 400^{\circ}C $ )

 $$ F_{u}(T)=F_{y}(T) $$ 

The uniaxial stress-strain-temperature relationship for structural steel at elevated temperature allowing for strain hardening may be calculated as follows (as shown in Figure C-A-4.2):

(a) When  $ 0.02 < \varepsilon(T) \leq 0.04 $ 

 $$ F(T)=\left[\frac{F_{u}\left(T\right)-F_{y}\left(T\right)}{0.02}\right]\varepsilon(T)-F_{u}\left(T\right)+2F_{y}\left(T\right) $$

(b) When  $ 0.04 < \varepsilon(T) \leq 0.15 $

(c) When  $ 0.15 < \varepsilon(T) < 0.20 $ 

 $$ F(T)=F_{u}\left(T\right)\left[1-\frac{\varepsilon(T)-0.15}{0.05}\right] $$

Table A-4.2.3 provides properties for Group 120 and 150 high-strength bolts at elevated temperatures expressed as strength retention factors, which are the ratios of bolt shear or tension strength at high temperatures with respect to the corresponding property at ambient temperature. The strength retention factors are based on a review of available experimental data (Gonzalez and Lange, 2009; Hanus et al., 2010, 2011; Kirby, 1995; Kodur et al., 2012; Li et al., 2001; Lou et al., 2010; Yu and Frank, 2009) and are consistent with values given in Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b). The available data indicates that retention factors are similar for both the shear and the tensile strength of bolts and are also similar for both Group 120 and 150 bolts. Consequently, Table A-4.2.3 specifies a single set of retention factors that are not, however, applicable to Group 144 or 200 bolts.

The strength of bolts depends on both temperature and temperature history. The strength retention factors given in Table A-4.2.3 assume the given temperature is the highest temperature to which the bolt has been exposed. For example, if a bolt

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_23_img_in_chart_box_111_742_754_1132.jpg" ></div>

is heated to  $ 1,000^{\circ} $ F ( $ 540^{\circ} $ C), and this is the highest temperature the bolt has seen, the strength of the bolt at  $ 1,000^{\circ} $ F ( $ 540^{\circ} $ C) can be computed as 42% of its normal room temperature value, as indicated in Table A-4.2.3. However, if the bolt has been heated to  $ 1,600^{\circ} $ F ( $ 870^{\circ} $ C), for example, and then cools to  $ 1,000^{\circ} $ F ( $ 540^{\circ} $ C), then the strength of the bolt at  $ 1,000^{\circ} $ F ( $ 540^{\circ} $ C) may be less than 42% of the room temperature value. Limited data on the temperature history dependence of bolt strength is provided by Hanus et al. (2011). The temperature history dependence of bolt strength can be important when evaluating connection strength during the cooling stage of a fire. An additional important consequence of this behavior is that bolts can suffer a significant permanent loss of strength after being heated in a fire and then cooled to room temperature. This permanent loss of strength can be important when evaluating the condition of a steel structure after a fire. Information on the post-fire properties of high-strength bolts is reported by Yu and Frank (2009).

Appendix 4 does not currently include provisions for computing the elevated temperature strength of welds because of the lack of experimental data on elevated temperature properties of welds made using typical U.S. welding processes, procedures, and consumables. However, some guidance on the elevated temperature strength of welds is provided in Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b).

### 4. Structural Design Requirements

The resistance of the structural system in the design-basis fire may be determined by the following:

(a) Structural analysis of individual elements where the effects of restraint to thermal expansion and bowing may be ignored but the reduction in strength and stiffness with increasing temperature is incorporated

(b) Structural analysis of assemblies/subframes/frames where the effects of restrained thermal expansion and thermal bowing are considered by incorporating geometric and material nonlinearities

(c) Global structural analysis where restrained thermal expansion, thermal bowing, material degradation, and geometric nonlinearity are considered

### 4 a. General Requirements

The requirement for general structural integrity is consistent with that appearing in Section 1.4 of ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022). Structural integrity is the ability of the structural system to absorb and contain local damage or failure without developing into a progressive collapse that involves the entire structure or a disproportionately large part of it. Commentary Section C1.4 of ASCE/SEI 7 (ASCE, 2022) contains guidelines for the provision of general structural integrity.

Most typical structural steel connections will comply with the Chapter B tie-force requirements for structural integrity at ambient conditions without reinforcement or other modifications. The exceptions to this generalization are seated, single-angle, and bolted-welded double-angle ("knife") connections (Gustafson, 2009). During a design-basis fire, large tensile and compressive forces develop in connections causing localized damage or failure of these and other types of connections (Agarwal

et al., 2014b; Fischer and Varma, 2015b; Selden et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2017; Choe et al., 2020). This research indicates that additional design enhancements for ductility and resistance may be necessary to meet the performance objectives of the building during a design-basis fire.

Filled composite columns and shear walls subjected to fire loading can effectively sustain load during a fire exposure without benefit of any external protection for the steel. The concrete infill mass provides both an increased capacity for absorbing the heat caused by the fire and load-bearing strength to, thereby, extend the fire-resistance duration. However, these composite members will experience internal pressure build-up due to the steam emanating from concrete at elevated temperatures. The steam needs to be vented out to prevent the pressure build-up and its adverse effects on the members. The magnitude and rate of internal pressure build-up for a design-basis fire depends on the fire protection and moisture content of concrete infill. Anvari et al. (2020b) have developed a rational method that considers these factors and can be used to calculate the size and spacing of vent holes required to limit the internal pressure build-up to a specified value.

### 4 b. Strength Requirements and Deformation Limits

As structural elements are heated, their expansion is restrained by adjacent elements and connections. Material properties degrade with increasing temperature. Load transfer can occur from hotter elements to adjacent cooler elements. Excessive deformation may be of benefit in a fire as it allows release of thermally induced stresses. Deformation is acceptable once horizontal and vertical separation, as well as the overall load-bearing capacity of the structural system, is maintained.

Membrane action of concrete floor slabs exposed to fire has received growing international research attention. Beginning with the landmark Cardington fire tests conducted during the mid-1990s in the United Kingdom (Newman, 1999), this high-temperature strength mechanism has been identified as a fire-resistance design alternative for composite or reinforced concrete floor systems. The novel advantage of this membrane action design is that it permits the secondary infill steel floor beams to be left unprotected, because they are designed for strength and stiffness primarily at ambient conditions. The tradeoffs are that the concrete slab, all the fire-protected perimeter girders of the floor bays, and their end connections must have adequate strength and ductility to bridge over an entire floor bay and the severely thermally weakened infill beams, such that an adequate load path is maintained to transmit the gravity design loads of the floor bay. Agarwal and Varma (2014) and Agarwal et al. (2014b) have demonstrated that the presence of steel reinforcement greater than the minimum shrinkage reinforcement in the concrete slabs, and fire protection of the single-plate connections facilitates the redistribution of gravity loading through membrane action and reduces the risk of progressive collapse of the structure. Bailey (2004) provides further background and the design criteria for how to effectively mobilize membrane action at large vertical deflections. There have been numerous other published papers on this research advancement, such as Zhao et al. (2008), Huang et al. (2004), and Bednar et al. (2013).

### 4 c. Design by Advanced Methods of Analysis

Designs by advanced methods of analysis are permitted for all structures, loading, and fire scenarios. The load combination of Appendix 4, Section 4.1.4 (Equation A-4-1), and the design-basis fire from Appendix 4, Section 4.2.1, are used for such analyses. While the advanced methods may be used for simple regular structures and individual member evaluations, it is particularly applicable and useful for large or complex structures with irregularities in structural geometry, layout, and stiffness, or structures exposed to complex loading and design-basis fire scenarios.

In addition to the applicable requirements of Appendix 1, Section 1.3.1, numerical models used for advanced analysis may explicitly account for one or more of the following: (1) initiation, growth, and evolution of the design-basis fire scenario throughout the structure; (2) spatial and temporal variations of temperatures in the structure during the fire event; (3) modifications in stiffness and strength of structural materials, members, and connections with variations in temperature; (4) thermally induced deformations, including large deformation effects and time-dependent (creep) effects; and (5) uncertainties resulting from variabilities in material properties, modeling assumptions, and numerical analysis approaches. The advanced analysis models typically account for all considered limit states, including excessive deflections, member instability, cracking, spalling, connection ruptures, local failures, and overall global collapse.

For example, Agarwal and Varma (2014), Agarwal et al. (2014b), Fischer et al. (2019), and Gernay and Khorasoni (2020) conducted advanced analysis of 3D building structures while accounting for all potential limit states, namely, inelastic column buckling, composite slab cracking in tension, yielding of steel floor beams and slab reinforcement, and deformation and fracture of various shear connections. They used the Eurocode stress-strain-temperature relationships to model the deterioration in strength and stiffness with increasing temperature. Sample results from one of their advanced analyses are shown in Figure C-A-4.3.

Advanced methods of analysis consist of direct simulation of the thermal and structural behavior and performance of the structure for the design-basis event. Typically, this consists of a performance-based, probabilistic approach to conducting design that must demonstrate an adequate level of safety in order to be approved by the authority having jurisdiction. This can be achieved through a number of different approaches at the discretion of the designer, who has the responsibility to demonstrate that the performance objectives and intent of the building code are being upheld. In most cases, advanced methods of analysis do not result in calculated load effects (demands or required strengths) for members and connections that would then have to be compared with calculated resistances (available strengths) based on values given in Appendix 4, Section A4.2.4d(a) through (h), or other resources in the literature. However, if one were to use this approach to evaluate capacity and demand using the LRFD approach,  $ \phi $ -factors can be included by further reducing the  $ E(T) $  and  $ F_{y}(T) $  material data with the appropriate  $ \phi $ -factor.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_18.md -->

Given the complexity of assumptions and numerical approaches used in design by the advanced methods of analyses, a peer-review team with applicable expertise and appropriate knowledge in this area may be engaged to review the following: (1) the calibration, benchmarking, or verification of the various modeling assumptions and approaches used, and (2) the results from the advanced analyses with respect to fundamental understanding of behavior and overall performance objectives established for the structure. It is important to note that some failure modes may not be simulated accurately, if at all, with advanced analysis methods; for example, concrete slab perforation, creep-related buckling, material behavior, and fracture in the cooling phase, etc. The results from such advanced analyses should, therefore, be treated with caution and engineering judgment.

### 4 d. Design by Simple Methods of Analysis

Design by simple methods of analysis permits two structural analysis approaches. As discussed in Chicchi and Varma (2022), engineering judgment is required to select the more reasonable, conservative, and appropriate approach for a structure, loading, and fire scenario.

The first approach may be more applicable to the stability and design of members, for example, columns, simply supported beams, composite girders, etc., in regular gravity frames. This approach assumes that the load effects (demands or required strengths) for the fire loading combination can be calculated using analyses similar to ambient conditions in accordance with Specification Section C1.2 or C2 with no additional changes in support or restraint conditions for individual members throughout the fire scenario. The factored resistance (available strengths) for individual members can be calculated using Appendix 4, Sections 4.2.4d(a) through (h).

The second approach may be more appropriate to the stability design of irregular structural frames with discontinuities in structural plan, geometry, or stiffness. This approach assumes that the load effects (demands/required strengths) for the fire loading combination can be calculated using elastic analysis methods of Specification Sections C2 or Appendix 1, Section 1.2, considering the following: (1) appropriate modifications to account for the effects of elevated temperature on member and connection stiffness, as applicable, and (2) thermal deformation effects due to maximum elevated temperatures and thermal gradients. The factored resistance (available strength) for members can be calculated using Section 4.2.4d(a) through (h), as applicable, or using other applicable resources in the literature [for example, Agarwal et al. (2014a) and Garlock and Quiel (2008)].

Even for fire design, all compactness and slenderness limits can be evaluated using ambient temperature values of E and  $ F_{y} $ . The Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2005d) provisions indicate that the plastic bending strength of composite beams during a fire exposure can be achieved for all nonslender shapes, which implies that for composite beams, the limiting width-to-thickness ratios can be the maximum AISC values for webs,  $ 5.7\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ , and for flanges,  $ 1.0\sqrt{E/F_{y}} $ .

Takagi and Deierlein (2007) have shown that the standard strength equations of this Specification at ambient temperature, with steel properties, E,  $ F_{y} $ , and  $ F_{u} $ , reduced for elevated temperatures, can overestimate considerably the strengths of members that are sensitive to stability effects. Special high-temperature equations developed by Takagi and Deierlein (2007) more accurately represent the strength of unrestrained compression members subjected to flexural buckling and flexural members subjected to lateral-torsional buckling. As shown in Figure C-A-4.4, these equations, first introduced in the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010), are much more accurate in comparison to equations from the ECCS (2001) and to detailed finite element method analyses (represented by the square symbol in the figure), which have been validated against test data.

The stability of steel structures under fire loading is governed by the fire resistance of gravity columns because they are most likely to reach critical temperatures and structural failure due to high utilization ratios (Agarwal and Varma, 2011, 2014).

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_23/doc_20.md -->

The fire resistance of gravity columns may be improved due to the rotational restraints offered by cooler columns in the stories above and below. This reduction in column slenderness,  $ L_{c}(T)/r $ , may be calculated using Equation A-4-10 or A-4-10M. The column in the heated story has a reduced flexural stiffness,  $ E(T)I $ , due to fire exposure. In the case of a one-story fire, the cooler columns above and below the heated column would have the larger intact EI, which provides rotational restraint and decreases column slenderness of the heated column. Figure C-A-4.5 shows this reduction in  $ L_{c}(T)/r $  with increasing temperature for columns with rotational restraints at both ends and one end only.

Compression members subjected to uniform heating have greater heat flux from all sides than members subjected to nonuniform heating. As a result, compression members subjected to uniform heating typically reach their failure temperatures much earlier than members subjected to nonuniform heating. Uniform heating will be the governing case for most fire scenarios (Agarwal et al., 2014a) in terms of time to failure.

Thermal gradients due to nonuniform heating reduce the axial load capacity of compression members due to elevated temperatures, bowing deformations resulting from uneven thermal expansion, and asymmetry in the column cross section resulting from uneven degradation of material properties (yield stress and elastic modulus). Several researchers have discussed these effects and proposed alternative design methods for columns with thermal gradients. Agarwal et al. (2014a) and Choe et al. (2016) conducted experimental and numerical studies to develop and verify design equations for compression members with thermal gradients. The parameters included in the study were member length, cross section, and axial loading magnitude. Three different heating scenarios were considered: uniform heating, thermal gradient along the flanges, and thermal gradient along the web. The studies indicated that columns subjected to uniform heating have much greater heat influx, and therefore, reach higher average temperatures faster than columns exposed to nonuniform heating. In most cases, uniformly heated columns reached their failure temperature earlier than nonuniformly heated columns with thermal gradients; exceptions were slender.

columns with very high axial compression (more than 50% of ambient capacity). The design strength of such columns can be calculated using equations presented by Agarwal et al. (2014a). These equations quantify the effects of elevated temperature, bowing, and cross-section asymmetry mentioned earlier. They were verified using the results of large-scale tests and numerical parametric studies.

Equation A-4-15 is used to calculate  $ F_{cr}(T) $  for structural members subjected to flexure when  $ L_{b} > L_{r}(T) $ . This equation is a modification of Equation F2-4 used to calculate the available flexural strength at ambient temperatures. These equations assume a constant value for shear modulus, G, which does not vary with temperature.

In reality, as shown by  $ G(T) $  in Table A-4.2.1, the shear modulus varies with temperature. The alternative equation mentioned in a User Note in Section F2.2 may be used to incorporate this change in shear modulus due to elevated temperatures.

The equations for compression strength of composite columns and composite plate shear walls at elevated temperatures have been developed based on parametric studies conducted by Anvari et al. (2020a) and Wazalwar et al. (2020). Wazalwar et al. (2020) developed a numerical tool to evaluate the fire performance of filled columns. The tool was benchmarked using existing experimental data for filled composite columns subjected to fire loading. The authors conducted a study to evaluate the effect of parameters, such as the aspect ratio (length-to-width ratio), section slenderness, and concrete and steel strengths on the strength degradation at elevated temperatures. Figure C-A-4.6 shows the comparison of Equation A-4-11 with the parametric study data from the tool. Equation A-4-11 provides a lower-bound estimate of filled composite column compression strength.

Anvari et al. (2020a) conducted detailed finite element analyses for composite plate shear walls, using models validated against experimental data. Figure C-A-4.7 shows the comparison of Equation A-4-12 with the finite element data. The data plotted include planar walls with a length-to-thickness ratio of 3 and corresponding unit width column strips (with no flange plates). Equation A-4-12 provides a lower-bound estimate of composite plate shear wall compression strength.

For composite plate shear walls, the simplified analyses can be conducted per unit width of the wall and one-dimensional heat-transfer equations can be used to model the thermal response. The unit width method for shear walls is conservative and can be used for different configurations of the walls, including planar walls and C-shaped walls (Anvari et al., 2020a).

For composite beams, Selden and Varma (2016) developed and benchmarked numerical models to determine their flexural strength at elevated temperatures,  $ M_{n}(T) $ , while considering the distribution of temperatures over the depth of the composite section, the degree or percentage of composite action in the section, member length, and the effects of elevated temperature on the material stiffness and strength of the steel beam, concrete slab, steel reinforcement (if any), and the shear force-slip behavior of the steel anchors. The results of comprehensive parametric analyses conducted by Selden (2014) were used to develop Equation A-4-20 and the retention factors in Table A-4.2.4.

A simplified thermal gradient profile along the depth of a composite beam has been prescribed when lumped heat capacity analysis is used to compute the single maximum temperature in the beam's bottom flange. The intent of this provision was to offer a convenient and conservative alternative to a more rigorous determination of

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_23_img_in_chart_box_208_611_652_1011.jpg" ></div>


 $$ P_{e}\left(T\right)\ =\frac{\pi^{2}EI_{eff}}{L_{c}^{2}} $$

the steel temperatures from thermal analysis and fire tests. Thus, a composite beam's temperature profile may be based on analysis or experimental data in lieu of this default thermal gradient.

The design strength for structural steel members and connections is calculated as  $ \phi R_{n} $ , in which  $ R_{n} $  is the nominal strength when the deterioration in strength at elevated temperature is taken into account, and  $ \phi $  is the resistance factor. The nominal strength is determined from Chapters C through K and Appendix 4, using material strength and stiffnesses at elevated temperatures defined in Tables A-4.2.1, A-4.2.2, and A-4.2.3. For limit states governed by steel yielding or rupture, the ambient temperature equations for nominal strength are used with elevated temperature material properties from Appendix 4, Section 4.2.3, and the corresponding tables. For limit states governed by buckling or instability, equations for nominal strength are provided in this section. For example, nominal strength equations are provided for design for compression and for flexure governed by lateral-torsional buckling.

While ECCS (2001) and Eurocode 1 (CEN, 1991) specify partial material factors as equal to 1.0 for “accidental” limit states, the uncertainties in strength at elevated temperatures are substantial and in some cases are unknown. Research is continuing on this topic. In the interim, ambient resistance factors should be used when determining design strength.

### 4 e. Design by Critical Temperature Method

The critical temperature approach provides an alternative method to the member resistance method in Appendix 4, Section 4.2.4d. This approach only considers uniform heating of individual members with wide-flange rolled shapes that have nonslender elements as defined in Section B4. Local buckling effects at elevated temperatures are thus precluded.

For yielding of tension members or continuously braced beams, the critical temperature is calculated based on the yield stress at elevated temperature in accordance with Eurocode 3 (CEN, 2005b) as shown in Figure C-A-4.8(a). Its formulation is the same as the mathematical relationship of the temperatures corresponding to retention factors for yield stress,  $ k_{y} $ , in Table A-4.2.1. This relationship holds true for ratios greater than 0.01. Thus, this relationship applies to most cases, as load ratios  $ R_{u}/R_{n} $  or  $ M_{u}/M_{n} $  less than 0.01 are highly unlikely due to the member self-weight.

For flexural buckling of compression members, the critical temperature calculated using Equation A-4-22 (A-4-22M) correlates closely with critical temperatures back-calculated using Equation A-4-9 for load ratios  $ P_{u}/P_{n} $  less than 0.6 (Sauca et al., 2021). As shown in Figure C-A-4.8(b), Equation A-4-22 (A-4-22M) provides a conservative lower bound (16% lower on average) relative to the column test data at load ratios greater than 0.3 (Sauca et al., 2021).

#### 4.3. DESIGN BY QUALIFICATION TESTING

in accordance with procedures set forth in ASTM E119, Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials (ASTM, 2020d). Since its inception in 1917, the ASTM E119 standard has been the long-standing basis for the fire-resistance ratings of building construction in the United States for compliance with the conventional prescriptive requirements of the building code.

Tested building element designs, with their respective fire-resistance ratings, may be found in special directories and reports published by testing agencies. Additionally, calculation procedures based on standard test results may be used as specified in Standard Calculation Methods for Structural Fire Protection (ASCE, 2005), Chapter 7 of the International Building Code (ICC, 2018), and published literature. These ratings, expressed as a time duration, were intended to be developed from full-scale furnace testing of construction assemblies (floors, roofs, walls, beams, and columns) conducted in accordance with the ASTM E119 standard and subject to its one specified fire time-temperature exposure and acceptance criteria. AISC Design Guide 19, Fire Resistance of Structural Steel Framing (Ruddy et al., 2003), provides additional guidance and design examples on the subject.

For building elements that are required to prevent the spread of fire, such as walls, floors, and roofs, the test standard provides for measurement of the transmission of heat. For load-bearing building elements, such as columns, beams, floors, roofs, and load-bearing walls, the test standard also provides for measurement of the load-carrying ability under the standard fire exposure.

It is noted that rated assemblies directly reflect one particular construction subassembly, its protection materials, and specific configuration that had been successfully tested. Furthermore, the test assemblies are constrained by the minimum furnace and test frame dimensions mandated by ASTM E119, which often does not represent typical spans or member sizes used in building construction. In this regard, the

ASTM E119 Commentary states the following: "It is the intent that classifications shall register comparative performance to specific fire-test conditions during the period of exposure and shall not be construed as having determined suitability under other conditions or for use after the exposure." The inventory of fire-resistance-rated assemblies, their components, and installation instructions have been catalogued by accredited laboratories, such as UL and Intertek, or other agencies, and maintained in databases for design reference by architects and engineers.

Over the many decades of standardized fire testing, various empirically based correlations of these data have been converted into equations and tabulations. These computational adaptations of fire-resistance-rated construction derived from ASTM E119 fire testing provide a convenient supplementary methodology for demonstrating code compliance that offers certain advantages over the sole reliance on the minimum requirements of individual rated assemblies. For example, a given assembly listing may indicate the minimum fire-protection thickness for a relatively small structural member. However, use of ancillary computations will commensurately reduce the required minimum protection thickness for larger members.

The primary source of accepted fire-resistance calculations for structural steel has been AISI and its ASTM E119 fire research conducted throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These industry-sponsored developments were originally captured in three AISI design guide publications (AISI, 1980, 1981, 1984), which were subsequently included in the preceding and current editions of Section 5 of SEI/ASCE/SFPE Standard 29, Standard Calculation Methods for Structural Fire Protection (ASCE, 2005) and in the U.S. model building codes. More recently, all of this information was summarized and well illustrated in AISC Design Guide 19. The standard fire protection and fire-resistance calculation methods for structural steel have now also been consistently transferred into the current National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and International Code Council (ICC) model building codes.

The inclusion of provisions for fire-resistance calculations in this Specification was motivated by AISC's and the steel industry's interest in duly maintaining this important content and contributing to its future progress. In this manner, AISC desires to parallel the development of prescriptive fire-resistive criteria for the concrete, masonry, and timber industries that are embodied in separate standards authored by the respective committees.

Many of the archaic types of fire-resistant steel construction that were common in the 1900 to 1950 era, including fire-protection materials such as lath and plaster and clay tile, have been provided in Table C-A-4.3. A more general version of this table that included concrete, masonry, and wood framing has been provided in the current and past editions of the International Building Code (ICC, 2018). While this information may not be relevant to new construction, it is helpful to design professionals and code consultants during the life safety review and renovations of existing buildings. The principal reference for this archival information is "Fire Resistance Ratings of Beam, Girder and Truss Protections and Assemblies, Column Protections and Assemblies, Floor-Ceiling Assemblies, Roof-Ceiling Assemblies, Wall and Partition Assemblies" (American Insurance Association, 1964).

Three other source reports of fire tests are as follows:

• “Fire Tests of Building Columns,” (Ingberg et al., 1921)

• “Fire Resistance and Sound-Insulation Ratings for Walls, Partitions and Floors” (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1944)

• “Guidelines for Determining Fire Resistance Ratings of Building Elements” (BOCA, 1994).

Additional guidance on the subject of older construction may be found in “Fire Ratings of Archaic Materials and Assemblies” (HUD, 2000).

For beam, floor, and roof specimens tested under ASTM E119, two fire-resistance classifications—restrained and unrestrained—may be determined, depending on the conditions of restraint and the acceptance criteria applied to the specimen.

### 2. Structural Steel Assemblies

Structural steel beams and columns, and floor and roof assemblies for building construction have undergone extensive fire-resistance testing over the decades in conformance with the ASTM E119 standard. ASTM E119 requires that the test assembly or member be subjected to a prescribed fire exposure in a furnace, which is known as the so-called standard time-temperature exposure curve. The assembly may be fire-tested in combination with superimposed loading or without. The resultant fire-resistance rating is expressed as the number of hours that the assembly or element was able to withstand exposure to the standard fire before a limiting ASTM E119 criterion was reached.

One critical test limit for loaded assemblies defined in ASTM E119 is structural integrity, which is reflected by the member's or assembly's capability to support the applied load (the maximum design load, unless specified otherwise) without collapse. The second endpoint, or the only one if the fire test is performed without loading, is a limiting temperature of the steel during the standard fire exposure. For floor, wall, and roof construction, an additional ASTM E119 acceptance criterion for rating purposes is the maximum temperature rise on the unexposed surface of the specimen, or ignition of a cotton wool pad. This thermal endpoint demonstrates the separation or compartmentation function of a fire barrier that is intended to prevent hot spots or localized breaches of the barrier that would enable fire propagation to adjacent spaces or floors. The standard ASTM E119 test can thereby evaluate both the heat transmission characteristics and structural integrity of specimens under a single controlled fire exposure.

Higher material temperatures cause a degradation of mechanical properties that reduces structural load-bearing capability. Structural steel will lose about 50% of its ambient strength within the 1,000 to 1,200°F (540 to 650°C) temperature range. These limiting steel temperatures prescribed in ASTM E119 are approximately related to structural failure in the context that such elevated steel temperatures will deplete a substantial portion of the member's typical design factor of safety or reserve strength. However, because structural instability depends on the governing limit state of the member, its stress and temperature distributions during the fire exposure, material overstrength, and other test assembly artifacts, the fire-resistance

rating for a loaded assembly based on structural failure will typically exceed the rating developed only for the applicable steel temperature limit(s) specified in ASTM E119. Thus, the ASTM E119 steel temperature limits are regarded as conservative indexes of structural fire resistance for collapse prevention.

Table C-A-4.4 summarizes the pertinent temperature endpoint criteria in ASTM E119 for the various types of structural steel members and assemblies. It is noted that the unexposed surface limits are expressed as a temperature change from initial ambient conditions, while the remaining limiting steel temperatures are final values.

Most of the steel column fire-resistance ratings have been developed exclusively from unloaded member fire tests limited only by the ASTM E119 steel temperature criteria due to the furnace and facility constraints of U.S.-based laboratories. Laboratories have also been reluctant to approach an imminent collapse condition during testing, which could damage their furnace and related equipment. In general, and apart

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_0.md -->

from load-bearing walls, it is acknowledged that most steel fire-resistance-rated assemblies, their correlated W/D and A/P design methods, and other formulations presented in this appendix, were developed primarily in the temperature domain for the corresponding ASTM E119 limits; however, a number of beam, floor, and roof assembly ratings were also established on the basis of structural performance.

These procedures establish a basis for determining the fire-resistance rating of steel construction assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant material, the weight, W, or area, A, and the applicable heated perimeter, D or P, of the fire-protection material or structural steel member. The W/D and A/P ratios are equivalent and mutually convertible section properties that represent their thermal inertia. W/D has conventionally been used for open wide-flange shapes, while A/P has been used for closed hollow structural sections.

The heated perimeter, D or P, is a function of the configuration of the steel fire-protection material installation, which can be in either a contour or box profile, together with the nature of the heat exposure on the steel member. The latter is typically characterized as either an all-around exposure of the steel shape, as for an interior column, or as a three-sided exposure of a floor beam supporting a concrete floor. Tabulations of W/D and A/P values for these cases and for standard rolled wide-flange shapes are available from multiple sources, including AISC Design Guide 19, Fire Resistance of Structural Steel Framing (Ruddy et al., 2003), and other publications.

Several equations are included in Appendix 4, Section 4.3, for calculating the fire-resistance ratings of structural steel assemblies. Table C-A-4.5 provides the respective references for each equation.

### 2 a. Steel Columns

## (b) Sprayed and intumescent/mastic fire-resistant materials

A/P is a directly convertible and equivalent steel section property to W/D, which has traditionally been used in fire-resistance computations for hollow structural sections (HSS). Similar to W/D for open wide-flange shapes, tabulation of A/P values for standard closed shapes with contour and box protection applications are available from multiple sources, including AISC Design Guide 19 and the published literature. The applicability limits of each given design correlation relative to the column assembly, sprayed fire-resistant protection product, A/P, rating duration, minimum required thickness, and the like must be followed to remain within the range of the existing fire test result range.

### 2 b. Composite Steel-Concrete Columns

## (a) Filled columns

Concrete-filled HSS can effectively sustain load during a fire exposure without benefit of any external protection for the steel HSS. The concrete infill mass provides both an increased capacity for absorbing the heat caused by the fire and load-bearing strength to thereby extend the column fire-resistance duration. Research conducted at the National Research Council of Canada (Kodur and MacKinnon, 2000) has provided a basis for establishing an empirical equation

to predict the standard fire resistance of filled round and square HSS for commonly used story heights and steel sections. This empirical equation was derived from and can only be used within the allowable range of design variables, as given, and is not applicable to lightweight concrete infill.

The fire performance of a filled HSS column is improved when heat absorption occurs as the moisture in the concrete is converted to steam. The heat absorbed during this phase change is significant; however, the resulting steam must be released to prevent the adverse effects of an internal pressure build-up within the HSS column. Thus, vent holes must be provided in the steel section, as indicated in the given limitation (4).

## (b) Composite columns encased in concrete

The fire-resistance ratings and requirements in Table A-4.3.6 were directly adapted from the ACI 216.1 (ACI, 2014) provisions for conventional steel bar-reinforced concrete columns. Substitution of an embedded structural steel shape for steel bar reinforcement should not reduce the fire resistance of the load-bearing concrete parts of a column, and the fire-resistance rating, R, computed for the same, but the assumed noncomposite steel column, accordingly verifies the fire resistance of the load-bearing steel shape. The concrete cover, h, is defined as identical to that used for noncomposite steel columns encased in concrete.

### 2 c. Composite or Noncomposite Steel I-Shaped Beams and Girders

In the past, the substitution of larger beams for the minimum required sizes has been permitted based upon the thickness of web and flange elements, W/D ratio, or the beam size designation. Extensive fire research has shown that the heat transfer to a protected steel beam or girder is actually a direct function of the W/D ratio. As

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_2.md -->

a result, beam substitutions should be more directly based upon W/D ratios. The significance of the thickness of web and flange elements and beam size is inherently included in the determination of W/D ratios.

It is acceptable and conservative to protect a larger steel beam or girder that has a greater W/D value than the W/D of the minimum member size specified in an approved assembly with the thickness of fire protection material required for the minimum member size.

In the application of the so-called member substitution equation for sprayed fire-resistance materials, reference to a selected fire-resistance-rated assembly, for the designated protection product and rating time required for the project, is necessary to identify the benchmark fire-protection thickness and accompanying W/D value of the steel shape in the rated assembly. The origins and example usage of this approach may be found in AISI (1984). Equation A-4-32 is the result of an analysis of data from nine restrained beam specimens tested in accordance with ASTM E119 Standard UL 263 (ASTM, 2020d). The analysis is contained in UL Report NC505-11 (UL, 1984). Additional background and examples for this are provided in AISC Design Guide 19. This general equation is only applicable to sprayed fire-resistance materials and not to intumescent or mastic coatings.

Adjustments to the fire resistance and protection thickness of beams and girders protected with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings are allowed based on the particular selected coating product and a standard fire-resistance-rated assembly in which it is listed.

### 2 e. Trusses

For trusses, application of the column fire-resistance equation is more technically correct than the beam equation, because truss members are predominantly axially loaded and will require larger protection thicknesses than beams. Also, most truss elements can be exposed to fire on all four sides simultaneously. As a result, the heated perimeter and protection thickness of most truss members should be determined in the same manner as for columns. However, an exception is included for top chord elements that directly support floor or roof construction. The heated perimeter and protection thickness of such elements may be determined in the same manner as for beams and girders, or they may be conservatively determined in the same manner as for columns.

Additional guidance and examples for structural steel truss fire protection may be found in AISI (1981) and in AISC Design Guide 19.

### 2 f. Concrete Floor Slabs on Steel Deck

The development of Equation A-4-33 for composite slabs with trapezoidal steel decking is described in Jiang et al. (2019). This equation is based on the thermal insulation criterion, which is specified as the time required for an average temperature rise of  $ 284^{\circ} $ F ( $ 140^{\circ} $ C) or a maximum temperature rise of  $ 356^{\circ} $ F ( $ 180^{\circ} $ C), whichever governs, to be reached at the unexposed surface of the slab when the slab is subjected to a standard fire from below. For this application, the steel deck is limited to trapezoidal profiles wherein the upper width of the deck rib is greater than or equal

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_3.md -->

to the bottom width of the deck rib. Equation A-4-33 is not intended to be used for corrugated deck panels. The equation is based on finite element analysis of composite slabs with different geometries exposed to the standard ASTM E119 fire. The finite element analyses were validated against experimental data from composite slabs tested under ASTM E119 fires. Jiang et al. (2019) show that the equation presents an improvement over the method provided in Annex D of Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2005d). Note that in practice, it is generally not possible to determine the actual value of the moisture content of concrete a priori, and even if that were possible, the moisture content could change during the service life of the structure. A moisture content of 4% for normal weight concrete and 5% for lightweight concrete can be used, consistent with CEN (2005d). For more conservative fire rating estimates, dry condition,  $ m = 0\% $ , may be used. Note that in addition to the thermal insulation criterion, Annex D of Eurocode 4 (CEN, 2005d) provides additional structural capacity criteria based on the calculation of the sagging and hogging moment resistance of the composite slab that can be used for estimating the capacity at elevated temperatures.

Equation A-4-33 is based on a thermal conductivity coefficient for concrete consistent with the upper limit assumed in the development of the Eurocode 4 provisions and should provide conservative estimates of fire ratings for composite slabs with siliceous or carbonate aggregates.

### 2 g. Composite Plate Shear Walls

Equation A-4-34 for determining the fire-resistance rating of composite plate shear walls is based on research conducted by Anvari et al. (2020b). The equation provides conservative failure times for walls subjected to standard ISO or ASTM fire scenarios. The equations are based on data obtained from experiments and benchmarked numerical models. The equation can be used for composite plate shear walls that meet the detailing and design requirements of Specification Chapter I, namely the steel plate slenderness and tie spacing requirements. The limits for applicability of Equation A-4-34 are based on the range of parameters considered in the study. For walls with slenderness greater than 20, one-sided fire scenarios may start controlling the failure of the wall and additional fire protection may need to be provided. Typical axial load ratios for composite plate shear walls are in the range of 10 to 20%.

### 3. Restrained Construction

The ASTM E119 standard provides for tests of loaded beam specimens in the restrained condition, where the two ends of the beam specimen (including slab ends for composite steel-concrete beam specimens) are placed tightly against the test frame that supports the beam specimen; therefore, during fire exposure, the thermal expansion and rotation of the beam specimen ends are resisted by the test frame. A similar restrained condition is provided in the ASTM E119 tests on restrained loaded floor or roof assemblies, where the entire perimeter of the assembly is placed tightly against the test frame.

The practice of testing restrained specimens dates back to the early fire tests over 100 years ago, and it is predominant today in the qualification of structural steel framed and reinforced concrete floors, roofs, and beams in North America. While the current ASTM E119 standard does provide for an option to test loaded beam specimens and

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_4.md -->

loaded floor and roof assemblies in the unrestrained condition, this testing option is rarely used for structural steel and concrete. However, unrestrained loaded floor and roof specimens, with sufficient space around the perimeter to allow for free thermal expansion and rotation, are common in the tests of wood and cold formed steel-framed assemblies.

Gewain and Troup (2001) provide a detailed review of the background research and practices in the qualification fire-resistance testing and rating of structural steel and composite steel/concrete girders, beams, and steel-framed floors and roofs. The restrained assembly fire-resistance ratings, developed from tests on loaded restrained floor or roof specimens, and the restrained beam fire-resistance ratings, developed from tests on loaded restrained beam specimens, are commonly applicable to all types of steel-framed floors, roofs, girders, and beams, with minor exceptions, as recommended in Table X3.1 of ASTM E119, especially where they incorporate or support cast-in-place or prefabricated concrete slabs. AISC Design Guide 19, Fire Resistance of Structural Steel Framing (Ruddy et al., 2003), provides several detailed examples of steel-framed floor and roof designs by qualification testing.

### 4. Unrestrained Construction

An unrestrained condition is one in which thermal expansion at the support of load-carrying elements is not resisted by forces external to the element, and the supported ends are free to expand and rotate.

However, in the common practice for structural steel and composite steel-concrete beams and girders, the unrestrained beam ratings are developed from ASTM E119 tests on loaded restrained beam specimens or from ASTM E119 tests on loaded restrained floor or roof specimens, based only on temperature measurements on the surface of structural steel members. For steel-framed floors and roofs, the unrestrained assembly ratings are developed from ASTM E119 tests on loaded restrained floor and roof specimens, based only on temperature measurements on the surface of the steel deck, if any, and on the surface of structural steel members. As such, the unrestrained fire-resistance ratings are temperature-based ratings indicative of the time when the steel reaches specified temperature limits. These unrestrained ratings do not bear much direct relevance to the unrestrained condition or the load-bearing functions of the specimens in fire tests.

Nevertheless, unrestrained ratings provide useful supplementary information, and they are used as a conservative estimate of fire resistance in lieu of the restrained ratings in cases where the surrounding or supporting construction cannot be expected to accommodate the thermal expansion of steel beams or girders. For instance, as recommended in ASTM E119, Table X3.1, a steel member bearing on a wall in a single span, or at the end span of multiple spans, should be considered unrestrained when the wall has not been designed and detailed to resist thermal thrust.

#### 5.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

The provisions of Appendix 5 cover evaluation of existing steel structures by analysis and by load testing for the load combinations in Section B2, with evaluation by load testing being limited to gravity load effects.

#### 5.2. MATERIAL PROPERTIES

### 1. Determination of Required Tests

The extent of tests required depends on the nature of the project, the criticality of the structural system or member evaluated, and the availability of records pertinent to the project. Thus, the engineer of record has the responsibility to determine the specific tests required and the locations from which specimens are to be obtained.

### 2. Tensile Properties

Samples required for tensile tests should be removed from regions of reduced stress, such as at flange tips at beam ends and external plate edges, to minimize the effects of the reduced area. The number of tests required will depend on whether they are conducted to merely confirm the strength of a known material or to establish the strength of some other material.

It should be recognized that the yield stress determined by standard ASTM methods and reported by mills and testing laboratories is somewhat greater than the static yield stress because of dynamic effects of tensile testing. Also, the test specimen location, for example, specimens removed from the flange of a shape versus specimens removed from the web, may have an effect on test results. These effects have already been accounted for in the nominal strength equations in the Specification, and as a result, no adjustments for specimen location and for dynamic effects of tensile test results are necessary when using nominal strength equations.

However, where strength evaluation is accomplished by load testing, the effects on yield strength of dynamic tensile testing should be accounted for in load test planning because yielding during the load test, where test loads are applied to the structure in a quasi-static manner, will tend to occur earlier than otherwise anticipated on the basis of a dynamic test yield strength. The static yield stress,  $ F_{ys} $ , can be estimated from the specified minimum yield stress determined by routine application of ASTM methods,  $ F_{y} $ , by the following equation (Ziemian, 2010):

 $$ F_{y s}=R(F_{y}-4) $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_6.md -->

 $$ F_{ys}=R(F_{y}-27) $$ 

where

 $$ F_{y}=reported yield stress,ksi(MPa) $$ 

 $$ F_{ys} = static yield stress, ksi (MPa) $$ 

R = 0.95 for tests taken from web specimens

= 1.00 for tests taken from flange specimens

The R factor in Equation C-A-5-1 and Equation C-A-5-1M accounts for the effect of the coupon location on the reported yield stress. Prior to 1997, certified material test reports for structural shapes were based on specimens removed from the web, in accordance with ASTM A6/A6M. Subsequently, the specified coupon location was changed to the flange.

### 3. Chemical Composition

Where a structure is to be repaired or modified by welding, chemical composition provides information that is used when preparing the weld procedure specification (WPS). This Specification requires determination of chemical composition because some older and pre-standardized structural steels may exhibit elevated levels of phosphorus or sulfur, among other chemical constituents, that may affect requirements to be specified in the WPS. Additionally, where the structural steel to be welded is an obsolete or pre-standardized structural steel, particularly those steels manufactured prior to approximately 1950, consideration should be given to use of metallographic examination to assess possible unsound features in the steel. Physical features that may adversely affect the soundness of structural steel to be welded include nonmetallic inclusions, stringers, voids of various shapes, tears, and segregation, among others. These unsound features are of concern because their presence may potentially lead to lamellar tearing in the steel at the completed weld. An experienced welding metallurgist should be consulted for the metallographic examination and for guidance with selection of weld joint details where unsound features are observed to be present in the steel to be welded.

### 4. Base Metal Notch Toughness

The engineer of record should specify the location of samples. Samples should be cored, flame cut, or saw cut. The distance from the edge of flat tension specimens (generally, specimens  $ \frac{1}{2} $  in. (13 mm) thick or less) need to be made only large enough to obtain the grip width. The distance from the center of a cylindrical tension specimen to either of the thermally cut edges should be 1 in. (25 mm) or larger. The engineer of record is responsible for determining if remedial actions are required to repair the sampling location, such as the possible use of bolted splice plates.

### 5. Weld Metal

Because connections typically have a greater reliability index than structural members (see Commentary Section B3.1), strength testing of weld metal is not usually necessary. However, field investigations have sometimes indicated that complete-joint-penetration groove welds, such as at beam-to-column connections, were not made in accordance with AWS D1.1/D1.1M (AWS, 2020). The specified provisions in AWS D1.1/D1.1M provide a means for judging the quality of such a weld. Where

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_7.md -->

feasible, any samples removed should be obtained from compression splices rather than tension splices, because the effects of repairs to restore the sampled area are less critical.

### 6. Bolts and Rivets

Because connections typically have a greater reliability index than structural members (see Commentary Section B3.1), removal and strength testing of fasteners is not usually necessary. However, strength testing of bolts is required where they cannot be properly identified otherwise, such as by observation of grade markings on bolt heads. Because removal and testing of rivets is difficult, assuming the lowest-strength rivet steel grade simplifies the investigation. Rivet grades can often be determined by referring to Section 1.3 of AISC Design Guide 15, Rehabilitation and Retrofit (Brockenbrough and Schuster, 2018.)

#### 5.3. EVALUATION BY STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### 2. Strength Evaluation

Resistance and safety factors,  $ \phi $  and  $ \Omega $ , reflect variations in determining strength of members and connections, such as uncertainty in theory and variations in material properties and dimensions. If an investigation of an existing structure indicates that there are variations in material properties or dimensions significantly greater than those anticipated in new construction, the engineer of record should consider the use of more conservative values.

### 2 a. Rivets

The values of  $ F_{nt} $  and  $ F_{nv} $  provided in Table A-5.3.1 for ASTM A502 Grade 1 rivets are based on the rivet design provisions of the 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b).

#### 5.4. EVALUATION BY LOAD TESTS

### 1. General Requirements

Generally, structures that can be designed according to the provisions of this Specification need no confirmation of calculated results by testing. However, special situations may arise where it is desirable to confirm by tests the results of calculations. Minimal test procedures are provided to determine the live load rating of a structure.

It is essential that the engineer of record take all necessary precautions to ascertain that the structure does not fail during testing. A careful assessment of structural conditions before testing is a fundamental necessity. This includes accurate measurement and characterization of the size and strength of members, connections, and details. All safety regulations of OSHA and other pertinent bodies must be strictly followed. Shoring and scaffolding should be used as required in the proximity of the test area to mitigate unexpected circumstances. During the load test, deformations are to be carefully monitored and structural conditions are to be continually evaluated. In some cases, it may be desirable to monitor strains as well.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_8.md -->

### 2. Determination of Load Rating by Testing

The live load rating established by testing presumes  $ \phi = 1.0 $  for all failure modes.

The engineer of record uses judgment to determine when deflections are becoming excessive and to safely terminate the tests even if the desired loading has not been achieved. Incremental loading is specified so that deformations can be accurately monitored, and the performance of the structure carefully observed. Load increments should be small enough initially so that the onset of significant yielding can be determined. The load increment can be reduced as the level of inelastic behavior increases, and the structural behavior at each load increment carefully evaluated to determine when to safely terminate the test. Periodic unloading, after the onset of inelastic behavior, will help the engineer of record determine when to terminate the test to avoid excessive permanent deformation or catastrophic failure.

It must be recognized that the margin of safety at the maximum load level used in the load test may be very small, depending on such factors as the original design, the purpose of the tests, and the condition of the structure. Thus, it is imperative that all appropriate safety measures be adopted. It is recommended that the maximum live load used for load tests be selected conservatively. It should be noted that experience in testing more than one bay of a structure is limited.

The provision limiting increases in deformations for a period of one hour is given so as to have positive means to confirm that the structure is stable at the loads evaluated.

### 3. Serviceability Evaluation

In certain cases, serviceability performance must be determined by load testing. It should be recognized that complete recovery (in other words, return to the pre-tested deflected shape) after removal of maximum load is unlikely because of phenomena such as local yielding, slip at the slab interface in composite construction, creep in concrete slabs, localized crushing or deformation at shear connections in slabs, slip in bolted connections, and effects of continuity. Because most structures exhibit some slack when load is first applied, it is appropriate to project the load-deformation curve back to zero load to determine the slack and exclude it from the recorded deformations. Where desirable, the applied load sequence can be repeated to demonstrate that the structure is essentially elastic under service loads and that the permanent set is not detrimental.

Because the amount of acceptable permanent deformation depends on the specific structure, no limit is specified for permanent deformation at maximum loading.

#### 5.5. EVALUATION REPORT

Extensive evaluation and load testing of existing structures is often performed where appropriate documentation no longer exists or where there is considerable disagreement about the condition of a structure. The resulting evaluation is only effective if well documented, particularly where load testing is involved. Furthermore, as time passes, various interpretations of the results can arise unless all parameters of the structural performance, including material properties, strength, and stiffness, are well documented.

# APPENDIX 6 MEMBER STABILITY BRACING

Appendix 6 includes the following major change in this edition of the Specification:

(1) The equation for required flexural strength of a torsional point brace has been revised.

This Commentary provides background to the development of the Appendix 6 equations and explains their application in the design for bracing of beams, columns, and beam-columns.

In the design of bracing for trusses, the compression chord may be treated as the compression flange of a beam. Further discussion of specific bracing applications for trusses and other systems is provided in this Commentary.

#### 6.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Winter (1958, 1960) developed the concept of a dual requirement for bracing design, which involves criteria for both strength and stiffness. Additional discussions are provided by Ziemian (2010). The design requirements of Appendix 6 are based upon this approach and consider two general types of bracing systems, panel and point, as depicted in Figure C-A-6.1. Prior to the 2016 edition of the Specification (AISC, 2016), the term relative bracing was used for panel bracing and nodal bracing was used for point bracing. The name change was made for clarity.

A panel-bracing system for a column is attached to two locations along the column length and may consist of systems such as diagonal bracing or shear diaphragms. The distance between these locations is the unbraced length,  $ L_{br} $ , of the column. The panel bracing system shown in Figure C-A-6.1(a) consists of the diagonals and struts that control the movement at one end of the unbraced length, point A, with respect to the other end of the unbraced length, point B. The forces in these bracing elements are resolved by forces in the beams and columns in the frame that is braced. The diagonal and strut both contribute to the strength and stiffness of the panel-bracing system. However, when the strut is a floor beam and the diagonal a brace, the floor beam stiffness is usually large compared to the stiffness of the brace and often can be ignored in the evaluation of the system stiffness. In such a case, the strength and stiffness of the bracing member and connection often controls the design of the panel-bracing system.

A point brace for a column limits movement only at the location it braces, and without direct interaction with adjacent braced points. The distance between adjacent braced points is the unbraced length,  $ L_{br} $ , of the column. The point-bracing system shown in Figure C-A-6.1(a) consists of a series of independent braces, which connect to a rigid abutment from the braced points including point C and point D. The forces in these bracing elements are resolved by other structural elements not part of the frame that is braced.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_10.md -->

Figure C-A-6.1(b) demonstrates panel and point bracing systems that might be utilized in beams. Effective beam bracing is achieved by preventing either lateral movement of the compression flange or twist of the cross section; therefore, as depicted in Figure C-A-6.1(b), beam lateral bracing can be provided by either a panel-bracing system that consists of a system with diagonals, or point bracing such as a link to an external support (such as another lateral brace). Alternatively, effective beam bracing also can be provided by a point torsional brace such as a cross-frame torsional or other flexural member that frames between two adjacent beams. A torsional brace such as a cross-frame, cross-beam, diaphragm, bridging,

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_24_img_in_image_box_168_356_693_727.jpg" ></div>

or girts/purlins combined with diagonal bracing between the beams restrains twist (not lateral displacement) of the beams at that particular location. With the required lateral and rotational restraint provided at the beam ends, the unbraced length,  $ L_{br} $ , in all of these cases is the distance from the support to the braced point.

The bracing requirements stipulated in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 allow for a member to develop a maximum load based on effective lengths,  $ L_{c} $  and  $ L_{b} $ , taken equal to the spacing between the brace points. The bracing requirements in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 generally are not sufficient to permit the development of member strengths based on  $ L_{c} $  or  $ L_{b} $  smaller than  $ L_{br} $ ; that is, the development of column or beam strengths based on a corresponding effective length factor of K < 1. Figure C-A-6.2 shows the critical buckling load versus the brace stiffness for an elastic cantilevered column with a brace of stiffness,  $ \beta $ , at its top. The ideal bracing stiffness for this column associated with  $ L_{c} = L_{br} = L $ ; that is, the bracing stiffness necessary to develop a column critical buckling load of  $ P_{cr} = P_{e} = \pi^{2}EI/L_{br}^{2} $ , is  $ P_{b}/L_{br} $ . A brace having 5 times this stiffness is required for the column to reach a critical load of 95% of  $ P_{cr} = \pi^{2}EI/(0.7L_{br})^{2} $  based on  $ L_{c} = 0.7L_{br} $ . An infinitely stiff brace is required theoretically to reach  $ P_{cr} = \pi^{2}EI/(0.7L_{br})^{2} $ .

In addition, the determination of bracing required to reach specified rotation capacities or ductility limits is beyond the scope of the Appendix 6 provisions.

Effective stability bracing must possess sufficient stiffness and strength. From a stiffness perspective, the respective provisions in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 for columns and beams stipulate a required brace stiffness,  $ \beta_{br} $ . Lateral bracing systems for columns and beams require at least twice the ideal stiffness while torsional bracing systems for beams require three times the ideal stiffness. The stiffness requirements include  $ \phi = 0.75 $  (LRFD) and  $ \Omega = 2.00 $  (ASD). The required brace strength,  $ P_{br} $ , is a function of the initial out-of-alignment of the brace points (out-of-plumbness in the case of vertical columns),  $ \Delta_{o} $ , and the brace stiffness,  $ \beta $ . The brace strength requirements are based on the nominal brace stiffness without the inclusion of  $ \phi $  and  $ \Omega $ . Separate resistance and safety factors are applied in the design of the bracing system components to resist these forces.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_12.md -->

The impact of brace stiffness on deformations and brace forces shows the same general trends for different types of bracing (panel or point). As an example, Figure C-A-6.3 illustrates the impact of brace stiffness on deformations and brace forces necessary to brace the top of a simply supported column. In this case, the bracing at the column top can be either a panel or a point bracing system because both behave identically. Other types of bracing show similar behavior for both columns and beams. If the bracing stiffness,  $ \beta $ , is equal to the ideal brace stiffness for a perfectly plumb member,  $ \beta_{i} $ , the displacement of the bracing system becomes large as the critical buckling load is approached, in other words, as P approaches  $ P_{e} $ , as illustrated in Figure C-A-6.3. Such large displacements would produce large

bracing forces, and  $ \Delta $  must be kept within reasonable tolerances for practical design. Providing a bracing system of twice the ideal stiffness for column bracing systems and beam bracing systems, with the exception of torsional bracing systems, and 3 times the ideal stiffness for beam torsional bracing systems limits the deformation to a value approximately equal to the initial out-of-alignment between the brace points,  $ \Delta_{o} $ , as the load approaches the critical buckling load corresponding to buckling between braced points, in other words, as P approaches  $ P_{e} $ , as illustrated in Figure C-A-6.3. The resulting brace force is a linear function of the magnitude of the initial imperfection. For columns, the value that is often used for the initial out-of-alignment,  $ \Delta_{o}=0.002L_{br} $ , equals the initial out-of-plumbness provided in the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges (AISC, 2022a).

In Figure C-A-6.3, for a brace stiffness of  $ \beta_{br}=2\beta_{i} $  and the initial imperfection of  $ \Delta_{o}=L_{br}/500 $ , the resulting brace force,  $ P_{br} $ , for this point-bracing system is equal to 0.4% of  $ P_{e} $  at  $ P/P_{e}=1.0 $ . Similar results would be obtained for the shear brace force,  $ V_{br} $ , in a panel-bracing system. In the foregoing,  $ L_{br} $  is the distance between adjacent braced points as shown in Figure C-A-6.4, and  $ \Delta_{o} $  is the relative lateral displacement of the braced points from the plumb (or aligned) position caused by erection tolerances, first-order effects from gravity and/or lateral loading on the structure, and first-order effects (i.e., the effects prior to amplification from member axial compression) from any other sources such as temperature movement, connection slip, etc.

As discussed in the user note in Chapter C,  $ \Delta_{o}=L_{br}/500 $  corresponds to an erection tolerance equal to maximum frame out-of-plumbness specified in the AISC Code of Standard Practice for Steel Buildings and Bridges. Similarly, for torsional bracing of beams, the important imperfection is an initial rotation,  $ \theta_{o}=L_{br}/(500h_{o}) $  (Wang and Helwig, 2005), where  $ h_{o} $  is the distance between flange centroids. For other values of  $ \Delta_{o} $  and  $ \theta_{o} $ , it is permissible to modify the bracing required strengths,  $ V_{br} $ ,  $ P_{br} $ , and  $ M_{br} $ , by direct proportion.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_24_img_in_chart_box_269_838_594_1134.jpg" ></div>


<div style="text-align: center;">Fig. C-A-6.4. Definitions of initial displacements for panel and point braces.</div>


<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_14.md -->

For bracing systems that restrain multiple columns, it is unlikely that all of the columns will be out-of-plumb in the same direction. For such cases, Chen and Tong (1994) recommend the use of an average initial displacement due to erection tolerances of  $ \Delta_{o}=L_{br}/\left(500\sqrt{n_{o}}\right) $ , where  $ n_{o} $  is the number of columns, each with a random  $ \Delta_{o} $ , stabilized by the bracing system. This reduced  $ \Delta_{o} $  is added with the first-order effects causing any additional out-of-plumbness or out-of-alignment between the brace points to determine the total force in the bracing system. In this situation, assuming a panel-bracing system, the total shear force in the bracing system can be calculated as

 $$ V_{br}=V_{1st}+2\frac{P_{r}}{L_{br}}\Delta_{o.total} $$ 

where

 $$ L_{br}=unbraced length within the panel under consideration,in.(mm) $$ 

 $$ P_{r}=\sum of the required axial forces in the columns being stabilized, kips(N) $$ 

 $ V_{1st} $  = first-order shear force in the bracing system due to gravity and/or lateral loading on the structure, temperature effects, etc., kips (N)

 $ \Delta_{o,total}= $  total relative displacement between the ends of the unbraced length under consideration due to erection tolerances, first-order effects of gravity and/or lateral loads on the structure, and first-order effects (i.e., the effects prior to amplification from member axial compression) from any other sources such as temperature movement, connection slip, etc., in. (mm)

In the absence of first-order forces in the bracing system, if the actual bracing stiffness provided (nominal stiffness with no stiffness reduction),  $ \beta_{act} $ , is larger than  $ \beta_{br} $ , the required brace strength,  $ V_{br} $ , in the case of a panel lateral brace, or  $ P_{br} $  in the case of a point lateral brace, can be multiplied by the following factor:

 $$ \frac{1}{2-\frac{\beta_{br}}{\beta_{act}}} $$ 

In the case of a panel-bracing system that contains a first-order shear force, this factor can be applied to the second term of Equation C-A-6-1, giving

 $$ V_{br}=V_{1st}+\frac{1}{1-\frac{\beta_{br}}{2\beta_{act}}}\frac{P_{r}}{L_{br}}\Delta_{o.total} $$ 

By substituting the expression for  $ \beta_{br} $  from Equation A-6-2, one can show that Equation C-A-6-3 states that the total shear force in the panel-bracing system is equal to the first-order shear force plus a  $ P-\Delta $  effect from the total vertical load being stabilized,  $ P_{r} $ , acting through the second-order relative end displacement of the panel (Griffis and White, 2013). The second term in the previously given equations for  $ V_{br} $  is based on the assumption of pins inserted in the column at each of the braced points, as in Winter's point bracing model (Winter, 1960). To account for the additional brace forces due to member curvature and member continuity across the braced points, the brace force, as defined by Equation A-6-1, is increased for point

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_15.md -->

bracing as explained later in Commentary Section 6.2. Prado and White (2015) and Lokhande and White (2015) observed that Equation C-A-6-2 tends to overestimate the reduction in the torsional brace strength requirement with increasing  $ \beta_{act}/\beta_{br} $ ; therefore, this equation is not recommended for application with torsional bracing.

Bracing systems often have multiple stiffness components that, combined, may impact the total brace stiffness. Many bracing systems behave as multiple springs in series. Potential components that can impact the stiffness of bracing systems are connections that may be flexible or can slip; therefore, the bracing system connections should be considered in the assessment of the bracing requirements. The connections and other components of the bracing system should be considered as components in series for the calculation of the bracing stiffness. Therefore, considering only bracing and its connections for point bracing, the actual bracing stiffness is tied to the connection and the brace stiffness by the relationship,

 $$ \frac{1}{\beta_{act}}=\frac{1}{\beta_{conn}}+\frac{1}{\beta_{brace}} $$ 

The resulting bracing system stiffness,  $ \beta_{act} $ , is less than the smaller of the connection stiffness,  $ \beta_{conn} $ , and the brace stiffness,  $ \beta_{brace} $ . Connection slip may be considered by increasing the value of  $ \Delta_{o} $  used in the calculation of the bracing force requirements, as long as  $ \Delta_{o} $  is small enough such that the brace is engaged well before the member reaches its maximum strength. Slip in connections with standard holes need not be considered, except when only a few bolts are used. This is in addition to the consideration of the fact that the initial  $ \Delta_{o} $  or  $ \theta_{o} $  is unlikely to be the same in each of the members, via recommendations such as those by Chen and Tong (1994) discussed previously.

When evaluating the bracing of rows of columns or beams, consideration must be given to the accumulation of the bracing forces and flexibilities (Ziemian and Ziemian, 2017, 2021), which may result in different displacements at each column or beam location. In general, the bracing forces can be minimized by increasing the number of braced bays and using stiff braces.

In certain cases, it may be more effective to determine the bracing stiffness requirements as a multiple of the ideal bracing stiffness determined from a computational buckling analysis. For lateral bracing of columns and beams, the multiplier should be  $ 2/\phi $  (LRFD) or  $ 2\Omega $  (ASD), while for beam torsional bracing the multiplier should be  $ 3/\phi $  (LRFD) or  $ 3\Omega $  (ASD). Although this approach can be applied to any column, beam, or beam-column, specific cases of interest include members with brace spacings that vary significantly along the member length, members with stepped or tapered geometry, situations where it is desired to increase the bracing stiffness and/or strength to satisfy high demands in one portion of a member but use lighter bracing in other regions, and partially braced members. The buckling analysis should account for the reduction in stiffness associated with the member elastic and inelastic strength limit states. Togay et al. (2015) summarize the stiffness reduction factors corresponding to limit states of Chapter E—column buckling, and Chapter F—I-shaped member lateral-torsional buckling. For design by ASD, the buckling analysis

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_16.md -->

must be carried out under 1.6 times the ASD load combinations and the resulting ideal bracing stiffness values are then multiplied by  $ 2\Omega/1.6 $  to obtain the required bracing stiffnesses.

#### 6.2. COLUMN BRACING

This section addresses lateral bracing of columns. Recommendations for torsional bracing of columns can be found in Helwig and Yura (1999). Section E4 addresses the calculation of the strength of columns that are restrained laterally at a location other than their shear center, and thus fail by constrained-axis torsional buckling. Lateral bracing requirements for the general case of beam-column members restrained laterally at a location other than their shear center are addressed later in Commentary Section 6.4.

For point column bracing, the critical stiffness is a function of the number of intermediate braces (Winter, 1958, 1960). For one intermediate brace,  $ \beta_{i}=2P_{r}/L_{br} $ , and for many braces,  $ \beta_{i}=4P_{r}/L_{br} $ . The relationship between the critical stiffness and the number of braces, n, can be approximated (Yura, 1995) as follows:

 $$ \beta_{i}=\left(4-\frac{2}{n}\right)\frac{P_{r}}{L_{br}} $$ 

The most severe case of many braces is adopted for the brace stiffness requirement in Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b, i.e.,  $ \beta_{br}=2\times4P_{r}/L_{br} $ . The brace stiffness in Equations A-6-4a and A-64b can be multiplied by the following ratio to account for the actual number of braces:

 $$ \left(\frac{2n-1}{2n}\right) $$ 

In Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b, when the actual brace spacing is less than the value of the effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , that enables the column to reach  $ P_{r} $ , the calculated required stiffness may become quite conservative because the stiffness equations are inversely proportional to  $ L_{br} $ . In such cases,  $ L_{br} $  can be taken equal to  $ L_{c} $ . This practice constitutes a simple method of designing for partial bracing; that is, bracing that is sufficient to develop the member's required strength but is not sufficient to develop the member's strength based on  $ L_{c} = L_{br} $ . This substitution is also permitted for beam point lateral bracing in Equations A-6-8a and A-6-8b.

For example, a W12×53 (W310×79) with  $ P_{u}=400 $  kips (1800 kN) for LRFD or  $ P_{a}=267 $  kips (1200 kN) for ASD can have a maximum unbraced length of 18 ft (5.5 m) for ASTM A992/A992M steel. If the actual brace spacing is 8 ft (2.4 m), 18 ft (5.5 m) may be used in Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b to determine the required stiffness. The use of  $ L_{br} $  equal to the value of  $ L_{c} $  in Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b provides reasonable estimates of the brace stiffness requirements; however, in some cases, this solution is significantly conservative. Improved accuracy can be obtained by treating the system as a continuous bracing system or directly determining the buckling strength of the partially braced member and the corresponding ideal bracing stiffness (Lutz and Fisher, 1985; Ziemian, 2010; Togay et al., 2015). The required bracing stiffness is taken as  $ 2/\phi $  (LRFD) or  $ 2\Omega $  (ASD) times the ideal bracing stiffness. Note that, as discussed in Commentary Section 6.1, for ASD, the ideal bracing

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_17.md -->

stiffness must be determined using 1.6 times the applicable load combinations and the resulting ideal bracing stiffness values are then multiplied by  $ 2\Omega/1.6 $  to obtain the required brace stiffnesses.

With regard to brace strength requirements, Winter's point bracing model only accounts for force effects from lateral displacement of the brace points and would derive a brace force equal to 0.8% of  $ P_{r} $ . To account for the additional brace forces due to member curvature and member continuity across the brace points, this theoretical force is increased to 1% of  $ P_{r} $  in Equation A-6-3. Member curvature and continuity across the brace points has a comparable effect on panel-bracing requirements. Therefore, the panel-bracing strength requirement of Equation A-6-1 is increased from 0.4 to 0.5% of  $ P_{r} $ . Similar increases are applied to the panel and point lateral bracing strength requirements for beams in Equations A-6-5 and A-6-7.

#### 6.3. BEAM BRACING

Beam bracing must control twist of the section, by either restraining lateral movement of the compression flange (lateral bracing) or by restraining twist of the section (torsional bracing). Similar to columns, lateral bracing can be either point bracing or panel bracing. An example of panel bracing is a shear diaphragm parallel to the plane of the compression flange that is supported by steel joists attached to the compression flange of a simply supported beam. An example of a point brace is the stiffness from guy cables, or a strut anchored to a rigid point, such as the core of the building, dead men, or theoretically rigid anchors. For maximum effectiveness, lateral braces should be connected as close to the compression flange as possible. Lateral bracing systems that are attached near the beam shear center or near the tension flange are generally ineffective in limiting the compression flange lateral displacements. An example of a torsional brace is a cross-frame or vertical diaphragm element spanning between adjacent girders that restrains twist of the girder. For a given torsional brace stiffness, the effectiveness of the brace is not generally sensitive to its location on the cross section, barring any distortion of the cross section; therefore, floor beams in a through-girder system can provide effective torsional bracing despite being connected to the tension flange.

For beams subjected to reverse-curvature bending, an unbraced inflection point cannot be considered a braced point because significant twist can occur at that point (Ziemian, 2010). Bracing provided near an inflection point must be attached at or near both flanges to prevent twist; alternatively, torsional bracing can be provided. A lateral brace on one flange is ineffective near an inflection point.

The beam bracing requirements of this section are based predominantly on the recommendations from Yura (2001).

### 1. Lateral Bracing

For beam lateral bracing, the following stiffness requirement is derived following Winter's approach (Winter, 1958, 1960):

 $$ \beta_{br}=\frac{2N_{i}C_{t}P_{f}C_{d}}{\phi L_{br}} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_18.md -->

where

 $ C_{d} $  = double curvature factor, which accounts for the potential larger demands on the lateral bracing in unbraced lengths containing inflection points, applied only to the point brace closest to the inflection point or to the panel brace corresponding to the unbraced length containing the inflection point, as well as the panel brace in the adjacent unbraced length closest to the inflection point

= 1 + (MS/ML)2, where the Cd factor is applicable as defined

= 1.0, otherwise

 $$ C_{t}=1.0\mathrm{~f o r~c e n t r o d i a l~l o a d i n g} $$ 

 $$ 1+(1.2/n) for top-flange loading $$ 

 $ I_{yc} $  = moment of inertia of the compression flange about its principal axis within the plane of the web, in.^{4} (mm^{4})

 $ M_{L}= $  absolute value of the maximum moment causing compression in the braced flange within the overall length, composed of an unbraced length containing an inflection point and the adjacent unbraced length closest to the inflection point, kip-ft (N-mm)

 $ M_{S}= $  absolute value of the maximum moment causing tension in the braced flange within the overall length, composed of the unbraced length containing an inflection point and the adjacent unbraced length closest to the inflection point, kip-ft (N-mm)

 $ N_{i} = 1.0 $  for panel bracing

= (4 − 2/n) for point bracing

 $$ P_{f}=\mathrm{beam~compressive~flange~force,~kips~(N)} $$ 

n = number of intermediate braces

The  $ C_{d} $  factor varies between 1 and 2, and is applied only to the point brace closest to the inflection point or to the panel brace corresponding to the unbraced length containing the inflection point and the adjacent panel brace closest to the inflection point. The term  $ 2N_{i}C_{t} $  can be conservatively approximated as 10 for any number of point braces and 4 for panel bracing, and  $ P_{f} $  can be approximated by  $ M_{r}/h_{o} $ , which simplifies Equation C-A-6-7 to the stiffness requirements given by Equations A-6-6a and A-6-6b and A-6-8a and A-6-8b. Equation C-A-6-7 can be used in lieu of Equations A-6-6a and A-6-6b and A-6-8a and A-6-8b.

The brace strength requirement for panel bracing is

 $$ P_{br}=\frac{0.005M_{r}C_{t}C_{d}}{h_{o}} $$ 

and for point bracing is

 $$ P_{br}=\frac{0.01M_{r}C_{t}C_{d}}{h_{o}} $$ 

These requirements are based on an assumed initial lateral displacement of the compression flange of  $ \Delta_{o}=0.002L_{br} $ . The brace strength requirements of Equations A-6-5 and A-6-7 are derived from Equations C-A-6-8a and C-A-6-8b by assuming top flange loading  $ (C_{t}=2) $ . Equations C-A-6-8a and C-A-6-8b can be used in lieu of Equations A-6-5 and A-6-7, respectively.

### 2. Torsional Bracing

Torsional bracing can either be attached continuously along the length of the beam (for example, a metal deck or slab) or located at discrete points along the length of the member (for example, cross-frames or secondary beam members). With respect to the girder response, torsional bracing attached to the tension flange is just as effective as a brace attached at mid-depth or to the compression flange, as long as distortion of the beam cross section is controlled. Although the girder response is generally not sensitive to the brace location, the position of the brace on the cross section influences the stiffness of the brace itself. For example, a torsional brace attached below midheight of the section will tend to bend in single curvature with a flexural stiffness of  $ 2EI/L $  based on the brace properties, while a brace attached on the top flange will tend to bend in reverse curvature with a flexural stiffness of  $ 6EI/L $  based on the brace properties. Partially restrained connections of the bracing to the girder being braced can be used if their flexibility is considered in evaluating the torsional brace stiffness (Ziemian, 2010).

The torsional brace requirements are based on the buckling strength of a beam with a continuous torsional brace along its length, as presented in Taylor and Ojalvo (1966) and modified for cross-section distortion in Yura (2001):

 $$ M_{r}\leq M_{cr}=\sqrt{\left(C_{bu}M_{o}\right)^{2}+\frac{C_{b}^{2}EI_{yeff}\overline{\beta}_{T}}{2C_{tt}}} $$ 

The term  $ C_{bu}M_{o} $  is the buckling strength of the beam without torsional bracing.  $ \underline{C}_{tt} = 1.2 $  when there is top flange loading and  $ C_{tt} = 1.0 $  for centroidal loading.  $ \beta_{T} = n\beta_{T}/L $  is the continuous torsional brace stiffness per unit length or its equivalent when n point braces, each with a stiffness  $ \beta_{T} $ , are used along the span, L, and the factor 2 accounts for initial out-of-straightness (the continuous torsional ideal bracing stiffness is thus taken as  $ \overline{\beta}_{T}/2 $ ). Neglecting the unbraced beam buckling term gives a conservative estimate of the torsional brace stiffness requirement as expressed in Equation A-6-11. For a doubly symmetric I-shaped cross section,  $ I_{y_{eff}} $  is equal to the moment of inertia about the principal axis within the plane of the web of the section,  $ I_{y} $ . For a singly symmetric I-shaped cross section,

 $$ I_{y e f f}=I_{y c}+\left(t/c\right)I_{y t} $$ 

where

 $ I_{yc} $  and  $ I_{yt} $  = respective moments of inertia of compression and tension flanges about their principal axes within the plane of the web, in. $ ^{4} $  (mm $ ^{4} $ )

c = distance from the neutral axis to the extreme compressive fibers, in. (mm)

t = distance from the neutral axis to the extreme tensile fibers, in. (mm)

The strength requirements have changed from the 2016 expression, which was found to underestimate the brace moments for large, unbraced lengths where elastic lateral deflections and twisting can become large at moments approaching the elastic critical buckling limit (Liu and Helwig, 2020). The strength requirement for beam torsional bracing is developed based upon the critical initial twist imperfection of  $ \theta_{o}=0.002L_{br}/h_{o} $ , where  $ h_{o} $  is equal to the depth of the beam (Wang and Helwig,

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_20.md -->

(2005). Based on the use of an effective bracing stiffness equal to 3 times the ideal torsional bracing stiffness, the torsional bracing required moment resistance may be estimated as  $ M_{rb} = \beta_{T} \theta_{o} $ . Using the formulation of Equation A-6-11, without  $ \phi $  or  $ \Omega $ , the torsional bracing strength requirement given by Equation A-6-9 is obtained. It is noted that this strength requirement was previously given in the Commentary to the 2016 Specification but  $ \beta_{T} $  is now modified to use a factor of 3 (instead of 2) on the ideal bracing stiffness. Reichenbach et al. (2021) found that a  $ \beta_{T} $  of 3 times the ideal bracing value is necessary to limit the additional elastic twist rotation under load approximately to  $ \theta_{o} $  at the elastic critical buckling limit, resulting in a total twist rotation of  $ 2 \theta_{o} $  under the load. The lower bound of  $ 0.02 M_{r} $  in Equation A-6-9, which was the strength requirement given in the 2016 AISC Specification (AISC, 2016), tends to govern at smaller unbraced lengths where the stiffness of the beam is reduced due to inelasticity.

The  $ \beta_{sec} $  term in Equation A-6-10 and defined in Equations A-6-12 and A-6-13 accounts for cross-section distortion. A web stiffener at the brace point reduces cross-sectional distortion and improves the effectiveness of a torsional brace. When a cross-frame is attached near both flanges or a vertical diaphragm element is approximately the same depth as the girder, then web distortion will be insignificant and  $ \beta_{sec} $  may be taken as infinity. The required bracing flexural stiffness,  $ \beta_{br} $ , given by Equation A-6-10 is obtained by solving the following expression, which represents the brace system stiffness including distortion effects:

 $$ \frac{1}{\beta_{T}}=\frac{1}{\beta_{br}}+\frac{1}{\beta_{sec}} $$ 

Yura (2001) provides additional guidance regarding the handling of cross-section distortional flexibility for cases where the bracing system is attached through only a portion of the depth of the member being braced.

Parallel chord trusses with both chords subjected only to flexural loading and with both chords extended to the end of the span and attached to supports can be treated the same as beams. In Equations A-6-5 through A-6-9,  $ M_{r} $  may be taken as the maximum compressive chord force times the depth of the truss to determine the torsional brace strength and stiffness requirements. Cross-section distortion effects,  $ \beta_{sec} $ , need not be considered when full-depth cross-frames are used for bracing. When either chord does not extend to the end of the span, consideration should be given to the control of twisting near the ends of the span by the use of cross-frames or ties.

For torsionally braced systems composed of two- and three-girder systems, the girder major-axis bending stiffness can lead to flexibility that lowers the effectiveness of the torsional bracing systems. Solutions are provided for estimating the girder major-axis bending stiffness (Yura, 2001; Helwig et al., 1993). For narrow girder systems (two- and three-girder systems with close girder spacing), the girders can be susceptible to the system mode of buckling, which is not sensitive to the brace spacing (Yura et al., 2008; Han and Helwig, 2020).

Beams—Point Torsional Bracing Combined with Lateral Bracing at the Compression Flange. Prado and White (2015) and Lokhande and White (2015) have suggested that for beams having point torsional bracing combined with panel or point

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_21.md -->

lateral bracing on the flange subjected to flexural compression, the required torsional and lateral brace stiffnesses can be reduced relative to the base values specified in Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, but should satisfy the following interaction equation:

 $$ \frac{\beta_{Tbr}}{\beta_{Tbro}}+\frac{\beta_{Lbr}}{\beta_{Lbro}}\geq1.0 $$ 

where

 $ \beta_{Lbr} $  = actual or provided lateral brace stiffness, kip/in. (N/mm)

βLbro = required lateral brace stiffness given by Equation A-6-6 for panel bracing or Equation A-6-8 for point bracing acting alone, kip/in. (N/mm)

 $ \beta_{Tbr} $  = actual or provided torsional brace stiffness, kip-in./rad (N-mm/rad)

 $ \beta_{Tbro} $  = required torsional brace stiffness given by Equation A-6-10 acting alone,

kip-in./rad (N-mm/rad)

Beams—Point Torsional Bracing Combined with Lateral Bracing at the Tension Flange. For beams having point torsional bracing combined with panel or point lateral bracing on the flange subjected to flexural tension, Equation C-A-6-12 applies and, in addition, the required torsional brace stiffness should be greater than or equal to the smaller of  $ \beta_{Pbro}h^{2} $  or  $ \beta_{Tbro} $ .

where

 $ \beta_{Pbro} $  = required point lateral brace stiffness given by Equation A-6-8, calculated using the unbraced length between the torsional brace points, kip/in. (N/mm)

 $ h_{o} $  = distance between the flange centroids, in. (mm)

The provisions of Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 apply for the lateral and the torsional brace strength requirements.

Reduction in Beam Bracing Requirements with Combined Torsional and Lateral Bracing. Equation C-A-6-12 recognizes the typical reduction in the beam torsional and lateral bracing stiffness requirements when lateral and torsional bracing are used in combination, thus restraining both twisting and lateral movement at the braced points. This linear interaction equation is known to provide a conservative estimate of the bracing stiffness requirements in cases where the lateral bracing is provided at or near the flange subjected to flexural compression (Yura et al., 1992; Prado and White, 2015; Lokhande and White, 2015).

For situations where the lateral bracing is located at or near the flange subjected to flexural tension, the lateral bracing system is ineffective on its own. However, a point torsional brace works effectively as a lateral brace to the compression flange, in the limit that the lateral bracing system stiffness becomes large. Prado and White (2015) and Lokhande and White (2015) show that the point lateral bracing stiffness requirement of Equations A-6-8a and A-6-8b, denoted by  $ \beta_{p_{bro}} $ , when multiplied by  $ h_{o}^{2} $ , serves as an accurate to conservative minimum limit on the required torsional bracing stiffness obtained from Equation C-A-6-12 for the case of point torsional bracing combined with lateral bracing at the tension flange. Furthermore, where  $ \beta_{p_{bro}}h_{o}^{2} $  is greater than the base torsional bracing stiffness requirement from Equation A-6-10, the torsional bracing stiffness need not be greater than the requirement from Equation A-6-10.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_22.md -->

The minimum required strength of the separate lateral and torsional bracing components is still governed by the provisions of Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2. The strength demands on the separate brace components are not necessarily reduced by the combination.

#### 6.4. BEAM-COLUMN BRACING

The provisions for beam-column bracing reflect the research by Lokhande and White (2015) and White et al. (2011). This research proposes the following guidelines for beam-column bracing.

Beam-Columns Braced by a Combination of Lateral and Torsional Bracing. For beam-columns braced by a combination of lateral and torsional bracing, the following applies:

(a) The required lateral bracing stiffness can be determined using Equations A-6-2a and A-6-2b for panel lateral bracing, or Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b for point lateral bracing, based on the required member axial force,  $ P_{r} $ . In Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b,  $ L_{br} $  can be taken as the actual unbraced length; the provision in Section 6.2.2 that  $ L_{br} $  need not be taken as less than the maximum permitted effective length based on  $ P_{r} $  should not be applied.

(b) The required torsional bracing stiffness can be determined using Equation A-6-10, with an equivalent moment equal to  $ M_{r} + P_{r} h_{o} / 2 $ , where  $ P_{r} $  is the axial force in the member being braced.

(c) The required lateral brace strength can be determined using Equation A-6-1 for panel lateral bracing, or Equation A-6-3 for point lateral bracing, based on 1.3 of the required axial force,  $ 1.3P_{r} $ .

(d) The required torsional brace strength can be determined using Equation A-6-9 with an equivalent moment equal to  $ M_{r} + P_{r}h_{o}/2 $ , where  $ P_{r} $  is the axial force in the member being braced.

Beam-Columns Braced by a Single Lateral Bracing System. For beam-columns braced by a single lateral bracing system attached at or near a flange subjected to flexural compression throughout the member length, the following applies:

(a) For panel bracing, when the opposite flange is subjected to a net tension force due to the axial and moment loading throughout the member length, the required bracing stiffness can be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-2a and A-6-2b with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ P_{r}/2 $  and Equations A-6-6a and A-6-6b with the required moment,  $ M_{r} $ . The required bracing strength can be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equation A-6-1 with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ P_{r}/2 $  and Equation A-6-5 with the required moment.

(b) For panel bracing, when the opposite flange is subjected to a net compression force due to the axial and moment loading at any position within the member length, the required bracing stiffness can be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-2a and A-6-2b with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ 2.5P_{r} $  and Equations A-6-6a and A-6-6b with the required moment,  $ M_{r} $ . The required bracing strength can be taken as the sum of the values determined using

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_23.md -->

Equation A-6-1 with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ 2.5P_{r} $  and Equation A-6-5 with the required moment,  $ M_{r} $ .

(c) For point bracing, when the opposite flange is subjected to a net tension force due to the axial and moment loading throughout the member length, the required bracing stiffness can be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ P_{r}/2 $  and Equations A-6-8a and A-6-8b with the required moment,  $ M_{r} $ . In Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b and Equations A-6-8a and A-6-8b,  $ L_{br} $  can be taken as the actual unbraced length; the provisions in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.3.1b, that  $ L_{br} $  need not be taken as less than the maximum permitted effective length based on  $ P_{r} $  and  $ M_{r} $ , should not be applied. The required bracing strength can be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equation A-6-3 with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ P_{r}/2 $  and Equation A-6-7 with the required moment,  $ M_{r} $ .

(d) For point bracing, when the opposite flange is subjected to a net compression force due to the axial and moment loading at any position within the member length, the required bracing stiffness can be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ 2.5P_{r} $  and Equations A-6-8a and A-6-8b with the required moment,  $ M_{r} $ . In Equations A-6-4a and A-6-4b and Equations A-6-8a and A-6-8b,  $ L_{br} $  can be taken as the actual unbraced length; the provisions in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.3.1b, that  $ L_{br} $  need not be taken as less than the maximum permitted effective length based on  $ P_{r} $  and  $ M_{r} $ , should not be applied. The required bracing strength can be taken as the sum of the values determined using Equation A-6-3 with an equivalent axial force equal to  $ 2.5P_{r} $  and Equation A-6-7 with the required moment,  $ M_{r} $ .

In the application of these guidelines, where the member is subjected to axial compression larger than  $ P_{c}/10 $ , the slenderness ratio,  $ L_{br}/r_{yf} $ , of the flange that does not have the additional lateral bracing should not be greater than 200,

where

 $ L_{br} $  = unbraced length between the points where the flange having the larger unbraced length is restrained laterally, in. (mm)

 $ P_{c} $  = available axial compressive strength of the member determined according to Chapter E, kip (N)

 $ r_{yf} $  = radius of gyration of the flange having the larger unbraced length, taken about its principal axis parallel to the plane of the web, in. (mm)

This avoids potential excessive amplification of the bracing demands in cases where one flange is braced at closer intervals while the other flange has a large brace spacing.

Summary—Additional Guidelines for Beam-Column Bracing. The guidelines for beam-column bracing recommended in the preceding discussion utilize a simplified combination of the requirements for columns and for beams from Sections 6.2 and 6.3, respectively.

For beam-columns braced by a combination of lateral and torsional bracing, the lateral bracing is designed based on the column bracing provisions of Section 6.2 given the required axial compression of  $ 1.0P_{r} $  for the lateral bracing stiffness requirement and  $ 1.3P_{r} $  for the lateral bracing strength requirement. Correspondingly, the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_24.md -->

torsional bracing is designed based on the beam torsional bracing provisions of Section 6.3 using an equivalent moment equal to  $ M_{r}/C_{b} + P_{r}h_{o}/2 $ . The second term in this expression accounts for the increased demands on the torsional bracing caused by the presence of the axial compression force.

For beam-columns braced by a single lateral bracing system attached at or near a flange subjected to flexural compression throughout the member length, and when the opposite flange is subjected to a net tension due to the axial and moment loading at any position within the member length, the lateral bracing may be designed based on the sum of the requirements from the column bracing rules of Section 6.2 with an axial force of  $ P_{r}/2 $  and the beam torsional bracing rules of Section 6.3 with the moment,  $ M_{r} $ .

The bracing requirements for other more general bracing configurations may be determined using a buckling analysis or a second-order load deflection analysis as discussed in Section 6.1.

# APPENDIX 7 ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF DESIGN FOR STABILITY

Appendix 7 includes the following major addition in this edition of the Specification.

(1) A limitation on the required axial compressive strength of nominally horizontal members in moment frames has been added to the conditions for using the first-order analysis method.

The effective length method and first-order analysis method are addressed in this appendix as alternatives to the direct analysis method, which is presented in Chapter C. These alternative methods of design for stability can be used when the limits on their use as defined in Sections 7.2.1 and 7.3.1, respectively, are satisfied.

Both methods in this appendix utilize the nominal geometry and the nominal elastic stiffnesses, EI and EA, in the analysis. Accordingly, it is important to note that the sideway amplification,  $ \Delta_{2nd-order}/\Delta_{1st-order} $  or  $ B_{2} $ , limits specified in Chapter C and this appendix are different. For the direct analysis method in Chapter C, the limit of 1.7 for certain requirements is based upon the use of reduced stiffnesses,  $ EI^{*} $  and  $ EA^{*} $ . For the effective length method and first-order analysis method, the equivalent limit of 1.5 is based upon the use of unreduced stiffnesses, EI and EA.

#### 7.2. EFFECTIVE LENGTH METHOD

The effective length method (though it was not originally identified by this name) has been used in various forms in the AISC Specification since 1961. The provisions are essentially the same as those in Appendix 7 of the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010).

These provisions, together with the use of a column effective length greater than the actual length for calculating available strength in some cases, account for the effects of initial out-of-plumbness and member stiffness reductions due to the spread of plasticity. No stiffness reduction is required in the analysis.

The effective length,  $ L_{c} = KL $ , for column buckling based upon elastic or inelastic stability theory, or alternatively the equivalent elastic column buckling stress,  $  F_{e} = \pi^{2} E / \left( L_{c} / r \right)^{2}  $ , is used to calculate an axial compressive strength,  $ P_{c} $ , through an empirical column curve that accounts for geometric imperfections and distributed yielding including the effects of residual stresses. This column strength is then combined with the available flexural strength,  $ M_{c} $ , and second-order member forces,  $ P_{r} $  and  $ M_{r} $ , in the beam-column interaction equations.

Braced Frames. Braced frames are commonly idealized as vertically cantilevered pin-connected truss systems, ignoring any secondary moments within the system. The effective length factor, K, of components of the braced frame is normally taken

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_26.md -->

as 1.0, unless a smaller value is justified by structural analysis and the member and connection design is consistent with this assumption. If connection fixity is modeled in the analysis, the resulting member and connection moments must be accommodated in the design.

If K < 1.0 is used for the calculation of the nominal compressive strength,  $ P_{n} $ , in braced frames, the additional demands on the stability bracing systems and the influence on the second-order moments in beams providing restraint to the columns must be considered. The provisions in Appendix 6 do not address the additional demands on bracing members from the use of K < 1.0. Generally, a  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  second-order elastic analysis is necessary for calculation of the second-order moments in beams providing restraint to column members designed based on K < 1.0; therefore, design using K = 1.0 is recommended, except in those special situations where the additional calculations are deemed justified.

The effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , may be taken as 0.5L for both in-plane and out-of-plane buckling of concentrically loaded compression braces in X-braced frames, where L is the overall length of the brace between work points, with identically sized brace members when the compression and tension braces are attached at the midpoint and the magnitude of compression and tension forces in the braces are approximately equal (McGuire et al., 2000). Greater unbraced lengths for out-of-plane buckling may be required for X-braced frames with unbalanced brace forces, particularly those with discontinuous midpoint connections (Davaran, 2001). Shorter unbraced lengths may also be justified (El-Tayem and Goel, 1986; Picard and Beaulieu, 1987; Nair, 1997; Moon et al., 2008).

Moment Frames. Moment frames rely primarily upon the flexural stiffness of the connected beams and columns for stability. Stiffness reductions due to shear deformations may require consideration when bay sizes are small and/or members are deep.

When the effective length method is used, the design of all beam-columns in moment frames must be based on an effective length,  $ L_{c} = KL $ , greater than the actual laterally unbraced length, L, except when specific exceptions based upon high structural stiffness are met. When the sideway amplification,  $ \Delta_{2nd-order}/\Delta_{1st-order} $  or  $ B_{2} $ , is equal to or less than 1.1, the frame design may be based on the use of K = 1.0 for the columns. This simplification for stiffer structures results in a 6% maximum error in the in-plane beam-column strength checks of Chapter H (White and Hajjar, 1997a). When the sideway amplification is larger, K must be calculated.

A wide range of methods has been suggested in the literature for the calculation of K-factors (Kavanagh, 1962; Johnston, 1976; LeMessurier, 1977; ASCE, 1997; White and Hajjar, 1997b). These range from simple idealizations of single columns, as shown in Table C-A-7.1, to complex buckling solutions for specific frames and loading conditions. In some types of frames, K-factors are easily estimated or calculated and are a convenient tool for stability design. In other types of structures, accurate K-factors are determined by tedious hand procedures, and system stability may be assessed more effectively with the direct analysis method.

Alignment Charts. The most common method for determining K is through use of the alignment charts, which are shown in Figure C-A-7.1 for frames with sideway inhibited and Figure C-A-7.2 for frames with sideway uninhibited (Kavanagh, 1962). These charts are based on assumptions of idealized conditions, which seldom exist in real structures, as follows:

(a) Behavior is purely elastic.

(b) All members have a constant cross section.

(c) All joints are rigid.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_28.md -->

(d) For columns in frames with sidesway inhibited, rotations at opposite ends of the restraining beams are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, producing single curvature bending.

(e) For columns in frames with sideway uninhibited, rotations at opposite ends of the restraining beams are equal in magnitude and direction, producing reverse curvature bending.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_24/doc_29.md -->

(f) The stiffness parameter  $ L\sqrt{P/EI} $  of all columns is equal.

(g) Joint restraint is distributed to the column above and below the joint in proportion to  $ EI/L $  for the two columns.

(h) All columns buckle simultaneously.

(i) No significant axial compression force exists in the girders.

(i) Shear deformations are neglected.

The alignment chart for sideway inhibited frames shown in Figure C-A-7.1 is based on the following equation:

 $$ \frac{G_{A}G_{B}}{4}\Big(\pi/K\Big)^{2}+\Bigg(\frac{G_{A}+G_{B}}{2}\Bigg)\Bigg[1-\frac{\pi/K}{\tan\big(\pi/K\big)}\Bigg]+\frac{2\tan\big(\pi/2K\big)}{\big(\pi/K\big)}-1=0 $$ 

The alignment chart for sideway uninhibited frames shown in Figure C-A-7.2 is based on the following equation:

 $$ \frac{G_{A}G_{B}\left(\pi/K\right)^{2}-36}{6\left(G_{A}+G_{B}\right)}-\frac{\left(\pi/K\right)}{\tan\left(\pi/K\right)}=0 $$ 

where

 $$ G=\frac{\Sigma\left(E_{col}I_{col}/L_{col}\right)}{\Sigma\left(E_{g}I_{g}/L_{g}\right)}=\frac{\Sigma\left(EI/L\right)_{col}}{\Sigma\left(EI/L\right)_{g}} $$ 

The subscripts A and B refer to the joints at the ends of the column being considered. The symbol  $ \Sigma $  indicates a summation of all members rigidly connected to that joint and located in the plane in which buckling of the column is being considered.  $ E_{col} $  is the modulus of elasticity of the column,  $ I_{col} $  is the moment of inertia of the column, and  $ L_{col} $  is the unsupported length of the column.  $ E_{g} $  is the modulus of elasticity of the girder,  $ I_{g} $  is the moment of inertia of the girder, and  $ L_{g} $  is the unsupported length of the girder or other restraining member.  $ I_{col} $  and  $ I_{g} $  are taken about axes perpendicular to the plane of buckling being considered. The alignment charts are valid for different materials if an appropriate effective rigidity, EI, is used in the calculation of G.

It is important to remember that the alignment charts are based on the assumptions of idealized conditions previously discussed—and that these conditions seldom exist in real structures. Therefore, adjustments are often required.

Adjustments for Columns with Differing End Conditions. For column ends supported by, but not rigidly connected to, a footing or foundation, G is theoretically infinite but, unless designed as a true friction-free pin, may be taken as 10 for practical designs. If the column end is rigidly attached to a properly designed footing, G may be taken as 1.0. Smaller values may be used if justified by analysis.

Adjustments for Girders with Differing End Conditions. For sideway inhibited frames, these adjustments for different girder end conditions may be made:

(a) If rotation at the far end of a girder is prevented, multiply  $ \left(EI/L\right)_{g} $  of the member by 2.

(b) If the far end of the girder is pinned, multiply  $ \left(EI/L\right)_{g} $  of the member by 1.5.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_0.md -->

For sideway uninhibited frames and girders with different boundary conditions, the modified girder length,  $ L_{g}^{\prime} $ , should be used in place of the actual girder length,

where

 $$ L_{g}^{\prime}=L_{g}\left(2-M_{F}/M_{N}\right) $$ 

 $ M_{F} $  is the far end girder moment and  $ M_{N} $  is the near end girder moment from a first-order lateral analysis of the frame. The ratio of the two moments is positive if the girder is in reverse curvature. If  $ M_{F}/M_{N} $  is more than 2.0, then  $ L_{g}^{\prime} $  becomes negative, in which case G is negative and the alignment chart equation must be used. For sideway uninhibited frames, the following adjustments for different girder end conditions may be made:

(a) If rotation at the far end of a girder is prevented, multiply  $ \left(EI/L\right)_{g} $  of the member by  $ \frac{2}{3} $ .

(b) If the far end of the girder is pinned, multiply  $ \left(EI/L\right)_{g} $  of the member by  $ \frac{1}{2} $ .

Adjustments for Girders with Significant Axial Load. For both sideways conditions, multiply  $ \left(EI/L\right)_{g} $  by the factor  $ \left(1-Q/Q_{cr}\right) $ , where Q is the axial load in the girder and  $ Q_{cr} $  is the in-plane buckling load of the girder based on K=1.0.

Adjustments for Column Inelasticity. For both sideways conditions, replace  $ \left(E_{col}I_{col}\right) $  with  $ \tau_{b}\left(E_{col}I_{col}\right) $  for all columns in the expression for  $ G_{A} $  and  $ G_{B} $ . It is noted that  $ \tau_{b} $ , as defined in Section C2.3, is being used as a simple conservative approximation for the  $ \tau_{a} $  expression that appeared in previous editions of the Commentary (AISC, 2005b). Adjustments for column inelasticity may be conservatively ignored and will result in larger K-factors.

Adjustments for Connection Flexibility. One important assumption in the development of the alignment charts is that all beam-column connections are fully restrained (FR) connections. When the far end of a beam does not have an FR connection that behaves as assumed, an adjustment must be made. When a beam connection at the column under consideration is a shear-only connection, that is, there is no moment, then that beam cannot participate in the restraint of the column, and it cannot be considered in the  $ \Sigma(EI/L)_{g} $  term of the equation for G. Only FR connections can be used directly in the determination of G. Partially restrained (PR) connections with a documented moment-rotation response can be utilized, but  $ (EI/L)_{g} $  of each beam must be adjusted to account for the connection flexibility. ASCE (1997) provides a detailed discussion of frame stability with PR connections.

Combined Systems. When combined systems are used, all the systems must be included in the structural analysis. Consideration must be given to the variation in stiffness inherent in concrete or masonry shear walls due to various degrees to which these elements may experience cracking. This applies to load combinations for serviceability as well as strength. It is prudent for the designer to consider a range of possible stiffnesses, as well as the effects of shrinkage, creep, and load history, in order to envelope the likely behavior and provide sufficient strength in all interconnecting elements between systems. Following the analysis, the available strength of compression members in moment frames must be assessed with effective lengths calculated as required for moment-frame systems; other compression members may be assessed using K=1.0.

Gravity-Only Columns and Distribution of Sideway Instability Effects. Columns in gravity framing systems can be designed as pin-ended columns with K = 1.0. However, the destabilizing effects  $ (P - \Delta $  effects) of the gravity loads on all such columns, and the load transfer from these columns to the lateral force-resisting system, must be accounted for in the design of the lateral force-resisting system.

It is important to recognize that sideway instability of a building is a story phenomenon involving the sum of the sway resistances of all the lateral force-resisting elements in the story and the sum of the factored gravity loads in the columns in that story. No individual column in a story can buckle in a sideway mode without the entire story buckling.

If every column in a story is part of a moment frame and each column is designed to support its own axial load, P, and  $ P-\Delta $  moment such that the contribution of each column to the lateral stiffness or to the story buckling load is proportional to the axial load supported by the column, all the columns will buckle simultaneously. Under this idealized condition, there is no interaction among the columns in the story; column sway instability and frame instability occur at the same time. Typical framing, however, does not meet this idealized condition, and real systems redistribute the story  $ P-\Delta $  effects to the lateral force-resisting elements in that story in proportion to their stiffnesses. This redistribution can be accomplished using such elements as floor diaphragms or horizontal trusses.

In a building that contains columns that contribute little or nothing to the sway stiffness of the story, such columns are referred to as leaning or gravity-only columns. These columns can be designed using K=1.0, but the lateral force-resisting elements in the story must be designed to support the destabilizing  $ P-\Delta $  effects developed from the loads on these gravity-only columns. The redistribution of  $ P-\Delta $  effects among columns must be considered in the determination of K and  $ F_{e} $  for all the columns in the story for the design of moment frames. The proper K-factor for calculation of  $ P_{c} $  in moment frames, accounting for these effects, is denoted in the following by the symbol  $ K_{2} $ .

Effective Length for Story Stability. Two approaches for evaluating story stability are recognized: the story stiffness approach (LeMessurier, 1976, 1977) and the story buckling approach (Yura, 1971). Additionally, a simplified approach proposed by LeMessurier (1995) is also discussed.

The column effective length factor associated with lateral story buckling is expressed as  $ K_{2} $  in the following discussions. The value of  $ K_{2} $  determined from Equation C-A-7-5 or Equation C-A-7-8 may be used directly in the equations of Chapter E. However, it is important to note that this substitution is not appropriate when calculating the story buckling mode as the summation of  $ \pi^{2}EI/\left(K_{2}L\right)^{2} $ . Also, note that the value of  $ P_{c} $  calculated using  $ K_{2} $  by either method cannot be taken to be greater than the value of  $ P_{c} $  determined based on sideway-inhibited buckling.

Story Stiffness Approach. For the story stiffness approach,  $ K_{2} $  is defined as

 $$ K_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{P_{story}}{R_{M}P_{r}}\Bigg(\frac{\pi^{2}EI}{L^{2}}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{\Delta_{H}}{HL}\Bigg)}\geq\sqrt{\frac{\pi^{2}EI}{L^{2}}\Bigg(\frac{\Delta_{H}}{1.7H_{col}L}\Bigg)} $$ 

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_2.md -->

in which  $ R_{M} $  is used to approximate the influence of  $ P-\delta $  effects on the sideway stiffness of the columns in a story and is defined in Equation A-8-8 as

 $$ R_{M}=1-0.15\Big(P_{mf}/P_{story}\Big) $$ 

where  $ P_{mf} $ ,  $ P_{story} $ , and H are as defined in Appendix 8, Section 8.1.3.

It is possible that certain columns, having only a small contribution to the lateral force resistance in the overall frame, will have a  $ K_{2} $  value less than 1.0 based on the term to the left of the inequality. The limit on the right-hand side is a minimum value for  $ K_{2} $  that accounts for the interaction between sideway and non-sideway buckling (ASCE, 1997; White and Hajjar, 1997b). The term  $ H_{col} $  is the shear in the column under consideration, produced by the lateral forces used to compute  $ \Delta_{H} $ .

Equation C-A-7-5 can be reformulated to obtain the column buckling load,  $ P_{e2} $ , as

 $$ P_{e2}=\left(\frac{HL}{\Delta_{H}}\right)\frac{P_{r}}{P_{story}}R_{M}\leq1.7H_{col}L/\Delta_{H} $$ 

 $ P_{story} $  in Equations C-A-7-5 to C-A-7-7 includes all columns in the story, including any gravity-only columns, and  $ P_{r} $  is for the column under consideration. The column buckling load,  $ P_{e2} $ , calculated from Equation C-A-7-7, may be larger than  $ \pi^{2}EI/L^{2} $  but may not be larger than the limit on the right-hand side of this equation.

In Appendix 8, the story stiffness approach is the basis for the  $ B_{2} $  calculation for  $ P-\Delta $  effects. In Equation A-8-7, the buckling load for the story is expressed in terms of the story drift ratio,  $ \Delta_{H}/L $ , from a first-order lateral load analysis at a given applied lateral load level. In preliminary design,  $ \Delta_{H}/L $  may be taken in terms of a target maximum value for this drift ratio. This approach focuses the engineer's attention on the most fundamental stability requirement in building frames: providing adequate overall story stiffness in relation to the total vertical load,  $ P_{story} $ , supported by the story. The elastic story stiffness expressed in terms of the drift ratio and the total horizontal load acting on the story is  $ H/(\Delta_{H}/L) $ .

Story Buckling Approach. For the story buckling approach,  $ K_{2} $  is defined as

 $$ K_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{\frac{\pi^{2}EI}{L^{2}}}{P_{r}}\left[\frac{P_{story}}{\sum\frac{\pi^{2}EI}{\left(K_{n2}L\right)^{2}}}\right]}\geq\sqrt{\frac{5}{8}}K_{n2} $$ 

where  $ K_{n2} $  is defined as the value of K determined directly from the alignment chart in Figure C-A-7.2.

The value of  $ K_{2} $  calculated from Equation C-A-7-8 may be less than 1.0. The limit on the right-hand side is a minimum value for  $ K_{2} $  that accounts for the interaction between sideways and non-sideways buckling (ASCE, 1997; White and Hajjar, 1997b; Geschwindner, 2002; AISC-SSRC, 2003b). Other approaches to calculating  $ K_{2} $  are given in previous editions of this Commentary and the foregoing references.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_3.md -->

Equation C-A-7-8 can be reformulated to obtain the column buckling load,  $ P_{e2} $ , as

 $$ P_{e2}=\left(\frac{P_{r}}{P_{story}}\right)\sum\frac{\pi^{2}EI}{\left(K_{n2}L\right)^{2}}\leq1.6\frac{\pi^{2}EI}{\left(K_{n2}L\right)^{2}} $$ 

 $ P_{story} $  in Equations C-A-7-8 and C-A-7-9 includes all columns in the story, including any gravity-only columns, and  $ P_{r} $  is for the column under consideration. The column buckling load,  $ P_{e2} $ , calculated from Equation C-A-7-9, may be larger than  $ \pi^{2}EI/L^{2} $  but may not be larger than the limit on the right-hand side of this equation.

LeMessurier Approach. Another simple approach for the determination of  $ K_{2} $  (LeMessurier, 1995), based only on the column end moments, is

 $$ K_{2}=\left[1+\left(1-\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}\right)^{4}\right]\sqrt{1+\frac{5}{6}\bigg(\frac{P_{story}-P_{mf}}{P_{mf}}\bigg)} $$ 

In this equation,  $ M_{1} $  and  $ M_{2} $  are the smaller and larger end moments, respectively, in the column. These moments are determined from a first-order analysis of the frame under lateral load. Column inelasticity is considered in the derivation of this equation. The unconservative error in  $ P_{c} $ , when it is based on  $ K_{2} $  determined from Equation C-A-7-10, is less than 3% if the following inequality is satisfied:

 $$ \left(\frac{\Sigma P_{ymf}}{HL/\Delta_{H}}\right)\left(\frac{P_{story}}{P_{mf}}\right)\leq0.45 $$ 

where  $ \Sigma P_{ymf} $  is the sum of the axial yield strengths of all columns in the story that are part of moment frames, if any, in the direction of translation being considered.

Some Conclusions Regarding K. Column design using K-factors can be tedious and confusing for complex building structures containing gravity-only columns or combined framing systems, particularly where column inelasticity is considered. This confusion can be avoided if the direct analysis method of Chapter C is used, where  $ P_{c} $  is always based on K=1.0. Subject to certain limitations, the direct analysis method may be simplified to the first-order analysis method of Section 7.3. Furthermore, when  $ \Delta_{2nd-order}/\Delta_{1st-order} $  or  $ B_{2} $  is sufficiently low, K=1.0 may be assumed in the effective length method as specified in Section 7.2.3(b).

Comparison of the Effective Length Method and the Direct Analysis Method. Figure C-C2.5(a) shows a plot of the in-plane interaction equation for the effective length method, where the anchor point on the vertical axis,  $ P_{nKL} $ , is determined using an effective length of  $ L_{c} = KL $ . Also shown in this plot is the same interaction equation with the first term based on the yield load,  $ P_{y} $ . For W-shapes, this in-plane beam-column interaction equation is a reasonable estimate of the internal force state associated with full cross-section plastification.

The P versus M response of a typical member, obtained from second-order spread-of-plasticity analysis and labeled “actual response,” indicates the maximum axial force,  $ P_{r} $ , that the member can sustain prior to the onset of instability. The load-deflection response from a second-order elastic analysis using the nominal geometry and elastic stiffness, as conducted with the effective length method, is also shown.

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_4.md -->

The “actual response” curve has larger moments than the second-order elastic curve due to the combined effects of distributed yielding and geometric imperfections, which are not included in the second-order elastic analysis.

In the effective length method, the intersection of the second-order elastic analysis curve with the  $ P_{nKL} $  interaction curve determines the member strength. The plot in Figure C-C2.5(a) shows that the effective length method is calibrated to give a resultant axial strength,  $ P_{c} $ , consistent with the actual response. For slender columns, the calculation of the effective length,  $ L_{c} = KL $ , and  $ P_{nKL} $  is critical to achieving an accurate solution when using the effective length method.

One consequence of the procedure is that it underestimates the actual internal moments under the factored loads, as shown in Figure C-C2.5(a). This is inconsequential for the beam-column in-plane strength check because  $ P_{nKL} $  reduces the effective strength in the correct proportion. However, the reduced moment can affect the design of the beams and connections, which provide rotational restraint to the column. This is of greatest concern when the calculated moments are small and axial loads are large, such that  $ P-\Delta $  moments induced by column out-of-plumbness can be significant.

The important difference between the direct analysis method and the effective length method is that where the former uses reduced stiffness in the analysis and K = 1.0 in the beam-column strength check, the latter uses nominal stiffness in the analysis and K from a sideway buckling analysis in the beam-column strength check. The direct analysis method can be more sensitive to the accuracy of the second-order elastic analysis because analysis at reduced stiffness increases the magnitude of second-order effects. However, this difference is important only at high sideways amplification levels; at those levels, the accuracy of the calculation of K for the effective length method also becomes important.

#### 7.3. FIRST-ORDER ANALYSIS METHOD

This section provides a method for designing frames using a first-order elastic analysis with the effective length,  $ L_{c} $ , taken as the laterally unbraced length with K = 1.0, provided the limitations in Section 7.3.1 are satisfied. This method is derived from the direct analysis method by mathematical manipulation so that the second-order internal forces and moments are determined directly as part of the first-order analysis. AISC Design Guide 28, Stability Design of Steel Buildings (Griffis and White, 2013), presents details of the method. It is based upon a target maximum drift ratio,  $ \Delta/L $ , and assumptions including the following:

(a) The sideway amplification,  $ \Delta_{2nd-order}/\Delta_{1st-order} $  or  $ B_{2} $ , is assumed equal to 1.5.

(b) The initial out-of-plumbness in the structure is assumed as  $ \Delta_{o}/L=1/500 $ , but the initial out-of-plumbness does not need to be considered in the calculation of  $ \Delta $ .

The first-order analysis method can be useful for rapid approximate, typically conservative, assessments of basic structures. The various approximations involved in the development of this method can make its accuracy suspect for general moment frames involving nonrectangular configurations of the framing and/or cases such

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_5.md -->

as clear-span portal frames where the roof girders or rafters resist similar or larger levels of axial compression compared to the nominally vertical members of the framing. Frames in which the axial loads in these nominally horizontal members are larger than approximately 10% of the elastic critical buckling strength of the member in the plane of bending,  $ P_{e1} $ , given by Equation A-8-5 with  $ EI^{*} $  taken as 0.8EI and with  $ L_{c1} $  taken as the laterally unbraced length of the member with K=1.0, can have potential significant stability interactions between the nominally horizontal and nominally vertical members that are not captured within the first-order elastic analysis method procedures. Equation A-7-1 represents a simplification of these details.

The first-order analysis is performed using the nominal (unreduced) stiffness; stiffness reduction is accounted for solely within the calculation of the amplification factors. The nonsway amplification of beam-column moments is addressed within the procedure specified in this section by applying the  $ B_{1} $  amplifier of Appendix 8, Section 8.1.2, conservatively to the total member moments. In many cases involving beam-columns not subjected to transverse loading between supports in the plane of bending,  $ B_{1}=1.0 $ .

The target maximum drift ratio, corresponding to drifts under either the LRFD strength load combinations or 1.6 times the ASD strength load combinations, can be assumed at the start of design to determine the additional lateral load,  $ N_{i} $ . If that drift ratio is not exceeded at any strength load level, the design will be conservative.

If this approach is employed, it can be shown that, for  $ B_{2} \leq 1.5 $  and  $ \tau_{b} = 1.0 $ , the required additional lateral load to be applied with other lateral loads in a first-order analysis of the structure, using the nominal (unreduced) stiffness, is

 $$ N_{i}=\left(\frac{B_{2}}{1-0.2B_{2}}\right)\frac{\Delta}{L}Y_{i}\geq\left(\frac{B_{2}}{1-0.2B_{2}}\right)0.002Y_{i} $$ 

where these variables are as defined in Chapter C, Appendix 7, and Appendix 8. Note that if  $ B_{2} $  based on the unreduced stiffness is set equal to the 1.5 limit prescribed in Chapter C, then

 $$ N_{i}=2.1\Bigg(\frac{\Delta}{L}\Bigg)Y_{i}\geq0.0042Y_{i} $$ 

This is the additional lateral load required in Section 7.3.2. The minimum value of  $ N_{i} $  of  $ 0.0042Y_{i} $  assumes a minimum first-order drift ratio, due to any effects, of  $ \Delta/L = 1/500 $ .

# APPENDIX 8 APPROXIMATE ANALYSIS

Appendix 8 includes the following major changes and additions in this edition of the Specification:

(1) The title of this appendix has been changed to permit inclusion of multiple approximate analysis methods.

(2) The approximate method for inelastic moment redistribution (often referred to as the nine-tenths rule) was relocated from Chapter B to this appendix.

Appendix 8 contains approximate analysis methods that may be used in certain situations as alternatives to more rigorous methods of analysis. Both are based on employing the results of first-order elastic analysis.

#### 8.1. APPROXIMATE SECOND-ORDER ELASTIC ANALYSIS

Section C2.1(b) states that a second-order analysis that captures both  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects is required. As an alternative to a more rigorous second-order elastic analysis, the amplification and summation of first-order elastic analysis forces and moments by the approximate procedure in this appendix is permitted. The main approximation in this technique is that it evaluates  $ P-\Delta $  and  $ P-\delta $  effects separately, through separate multipliers,  $ B_{2} $  and  $ B_{1} $ , respectively, considering the influence of  $ P-\delta $  effects on the overall response of the structure (which, in turn, influences  $ P-\Delta $ ) only indirectly, through the factor  $ R_{M} $ . A more rigorous second-order elastic analysis is recommended for accurate determination of the frame internal forces when  $ B_{1} $  is larger than 1.2 in members that have a significant effect on the response of the overall structure.

This procedure uses a first-order elastic analysis with amplification factors that are applied to the first-order forces and moments to obtain an estimate of the second-order forces and moments. In the general case, a member may have first-order load effects not associated with sideways that are multiplied by the factor  $ B_{1} $ , and first-order load effects produced by sideways that are multiplied by the factor  $ B_{2} $ . The factor  $ B_{1} $  estimates the  $ P-\delta $  effects on the nonsway moments in compression members. The factor  $ B_{2} $  estimates the  $ P-\Delta $  effects on the forces and moments in all members. These effects are shown graphically in Figures C-C2.1 and C-A-8.1.

The factor  $ B_{2} $  applies only to internal forces associated with sideways and is calculated for an entire story. In building frames designed to limit  $ \Delta_{H}/L $  to a predetermined value, the factor  $ B_{2} $  may be found in advance of designing individual members by using the target maximum limit on  $ \Delta_{H}/L $  within Equation A-8-7. Drift limits may also be set for design of various categories of buildings so that the effect of secondary bending is reduced (ATC, 1978; Kanchanalai and Lu, 1979). However, drift limits alone are not sufficient to allow stability effects to be neglected (LeMessurier, 1977).

In determining  $ B_{2} $  and the second-order effects on the lateral force-resisting system, it is important that  $ \Delta_{H} $  include not only the interstory displacement in the plane of the lateral force-resisting system, but also any additional displacement in the floor or roof diaphragm or horizontal framing system that may increase the overturning effect of columns attached to and “leaning” against the horizontal system. Either the maximum displacement or a weighted average displacement, weighted in proportion to column load, should be considered.

The Specification provides only one equation, Equation A-8-7, for determining the elastic buckling strength of a story. This formula is based on the lateral stiffness of the story as determined from a first-order analysis and is applicable to all buildings. The 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b) offered a second formula based on the lateral buckling strength of individual columns, applicable only to buildings in which lateral stiffness is provided entirely by moment frames; that equation is

 $$ P_{e\ story}=\sum\frac{\pi^{2}EI}{\left(K_{2}L\right)^{2}} $$ 

where

 $ K_{2} $  = effective length factor in the plane of bending, calculated from a side-

L = story height, in. (mm)

 $ P_{e\ story}= $  elastic buckling strength of the story, kips (N)

This equation for the story elastic buckling strength was eliminated from the 2010 AISC Specification (AISC, 2010) because of its limited applicability, the difficulty involved in calculating  $ K_{2} $  correctly, and the greater ease of application of the story stiffness-based formula. Additionally, with the deletion of this equation, the expression  $ \Sigma P_{e2} $  was changed to  $ P_{e} $  story because the story buckling strength is not the summation of the strengths of individual columns, as implied by the earlier symbol.

First-order member forces and moments with the structure restrained against side-sway are labeled  $ P_{nt} $  and  $ M_{nt} $ ; the first-order effects of lateral translation are labeled  $ P_{lt} $  and  $ M_{lt} $ . For structures where gravity load causes negligible lateral translation,  $ P_{nt} $  and  $ M_{nt} $  are the effects of gravity load and  $ P_{lt} $  and  $ M_{lt} $  are the effects of lateral load. In the general case,  $ P_{nt} $  and  $ M_{nt} $  are the results of an analysis with the structure restrained against sideways;  $ P_{lt} $  and  $ M_{lt} $  are from an analysis with the lateral reactions from the first analysis (as used to find  $ P_{nt} $  and  $ M_{nt} $ ) applied as lateral loads. Algebraic addition of the two sets of forces and moments after application of multipliers  $ B_{1} $  and  $ B_{2} $ , as specified in Equations A-8-1 and A-8-2, gives reasonably accurate values of the overall second-order forces and moments.

The  $ B_{2} $  multiplier is applicable to forces and moments  $ P_{lt} $  and  $ M_{lt} $  in all members, including beams, columns, bracing diagonals, and shear walls, that participate in resisting lateral load.  $ P_{lt} $  and  $ M_{lt} $  will be zero in members that do not participate in resisting lateral load; hence,  $ B_{2} $  will have no effect on them. The  $ B_{1} $  multiplier is applicable only to compression members.

If  $ B_{2} $  for a particular direction of translation does not vary significantly among the stories of a building, it will be convenient to use the maximum value for all stories, leading to just two  $ B_{2} $  values, one for each direction, for the entire building. Where  $ B_{2} $  does vary significantly between stories, the multiplier for beams between stories should be the larger value.

When first-order end moments in columns are magnified by  $ B_{1} $  and  $ B_{2} $  factors, equilibrium requires that they be balanced by moments in the beams that connect to them as illustrated in Figure C-A-8.1. The  $ B_{2} $  multiplier does not cause any difficulty in this regard because it is applied to all members. The  $ B_{1} $  multiplier, however, is applied only to compression members. The associated second-order internal moments in the connected members can be accounted for by amplifying the moments in those members by the  $ B_{1} $  value of the compression member using the largest  $ B_{1} $  value, if there are two or more compression members at the joint. Alternatively, the difference between the magnified moment, considering  $ B_{1} $  only, and the first-order moment in the compression member(s) at a given joint may be distributed to any other moment-resisting members attached to the compression member(s) in proportion to the relative stiffness of those members. Minor imbalances may be neglected, based upon engineering judgment. Complex conditions may be treated more expeditiously with a more rigorous second-order analysis.

In braced frames and moment frames,  $ P_{c} $  is governed by the maximum slenderness ratio regardless of the plane of bending, if the member is subjected to significant biaxial bending, or the provisions in Section H1.3 are not utilized. Section H1.3 is an alternative approach for checking beam-column strength that provides for the

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_9.md -->

separate checking of beam-column in-plane and out-of-plane stability in members predominantly subjected to bending within the plane of the frame. However,  $ P_{e1} $  expressed by Equation A-8-5 is always calculated using the slenderness ratio in the plane of bending. Thus, when flexure in a beam-column is about the major axis only, two different values of slenderness ratio may be involved in the amplified first-order elastic analysis and strength check calculations.

The factor  $ R_{M} $  in Equation A-8-7 accounts for the influence of  $ P-\delta $  effects on sideway amplification.  $ R_{M} $  can be taken as 0.85 as a lower-bound value for stories that include moment frames (LeMessurier, 1977);  $ R_{M}=1 $  if there are no moment frames in the story. Equation A-8-8 can be used for greater precision between these extreme values.

Second-order internal forces from separate structural analyses cannot normally be combined by superposition because second-order amplification is a nonlinear effect based on the total axial forces within the structure; therefore, a separate analysis must be conducted for each load combination considered in the design. However, in the amplified first-order elastic analysis procedure of Section 8.1, the first-order internal forces, calculated prior to amplification, may be superimposed to determine the total first-order internal forces.

Equivalent Uniform Moment Factor,  $ C_{m} $ , and Effective Length Factor, K. Equations A-8-3 and A-8-4 are used to approximate the maximum second-order moments in compression members with no relative joint translation and no transverse loads between the ends of the member. Figure C-A-8.2 compares the approximation for  $ C_{m} $ 

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="merged_aisc_images/AISC_360-22w_part_25_img_in_chart_box_178_680_684_1146.jpg" ></div>

in Equation A-8-4 to the exact theoretical solution for beam-columns subjected to applied end moments (Chen and Lui, 1987). The approximate and analytical values of  $ C_{m} $  are plotted versus the end-moment ratio,  $ M_{1}/M_{2} $ , for several values of  $ P/P_{e} $  ( $ P_{e}=P_{e1} $  with K=1). The corresponding approximate and analytical solutions are shown in Figure C-A-8.3 for the maximum second-order elastic moment within the member,  $ M_{r} $ , versus the axial load level,  $ P/P_{e} $ , for several values of the end-moment ratio,  $ M_{1}/M_{2} $ .

For beam-columns with transverse loadings, the second-order moment can be approximated for simply supported members with

 $$ C_{m}=1+\psi\alpha P_{r}/P_{e1} $$ 

where

 $ M_{o} $  = maximum first-order moment within the member due to the transverse loading, kip-in. (N-mm)

 $$ \alpha_{ 冚 }=1.0(LRFD)or1.6(ASD) $$ 

 $$ \Psi_{ 冚 }=\frac{\pi^{2}\delta_{o}E I}{M_{o}L^{2}}-1 $$ 

 $$ \delta_{o}=\mathrm{maximum~deflection~due~to~transverse~loading,~in.~(mm)} $$ 

For restrained ends, some limiting cases are given in Table C-A-8.1 together with two cases of simply supported beam-columns (Iwankiw, 1984). These values of  $ C_{m} $  are always used with the maximum moment in the member. For the restrained-end cases, the values of  $ B_{1} $  are most accurate if the effective length in the plane of bending,

corresponding to the member end conditions, used in calculating  $ P_{e1} $ , is less than the laterally unbraced length of the member  $ (K < 1.0) $ .

In lieu of using the equations given in Table C-A-8.1, the use of  $ C_{m}=1.0 $  is conservative for all transversely loaded members. It can be shown that the use of  $ C_{m}=0.85 $  for members with restrained ends, as specified in AISC Specifications prior to 2005, can sometimes result in a significant underestimation of the internal moments; therefore, the use of  $ C_{m}=1.0 $  is recommended as a simple conservative approximation for all cases involving transversely loaded members.

In approximating a second-order analysis by amplification of the results of a first-order analysis, the effective length,  $ L_{c1} $ , is used in the determination of the elastic critical buckling load,  $ P_{e1} $ , for a member. This elastic critical buckling load is then used for calculation of the corresponding amplification factor,  $ B_{1} $ .

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_12.md -->

 $ B_{1} $  is used to estimate the  $ P-\delta $  effects on the nonsway moments,  $ M_{nt} $ , in compression members. The unbraced length,  $ L_{c1} $ , is calculated in the plane of bending based on no translation of the ends of the member and is normally set to the laterally unbraced length of the member, unless a smaller value is justified on the basis of analysis.

Because the amplified first-order elastic analysis involves the calculation of elastic buckling loads as a measure of frame and column stiffness, only elastic effective length K-factors are appropriate for this use.

Summary—Application of Multipliers  $ B_{1} $  and  $ B_{2} $ . There is a single  $ B_{2} $  value for each story and each direction of lateral translation of the story, say  $ B_{2X} $  and  $ B_{2Y} $  for the two global directions. Multiplier  $ B_{2X} $  is applicable to all axial and shear forces and moments produced by story translation in the global X-direction. Thus, in the common case where gravity load produces no lateral translation and all X translation is the result of lateral load in the X-direction,  $ B_{2X} $  is applicable to all axial and shear forces, and moments produced by lateral load in the global X-direction. Similarly,  $ B_{2Y} $  is applicable in the Y-direction.

Note that  $ B_{2X} $  and  $ B_{2Y} $  are associated with global axes X and Y and the direction of story translation or loading, but are completely unrelated to the direction of bending of individual members. Thus, for example, if lateral load or translation in the global X-direction causes moments  $ M_{x} $  and  $ M_{y} $  about member x- and y-axes in a particular member,  $ B_{2X} $  must be applied to both  $ M_{x} $  and  $ M_{y} $ .

There is a separate  $ B_{1} $  value for every member subjected to compression and flexure and each direction of bending of the member, say  $ B_{1x} $  and  $ B_{1y} $  for the two member axes. Multiplier  $ B_{1x} $  is applicable to the member x-axis moment, regardless of the load that causes that moment. Similarly,  $ B_{1y} $  is applicable to the member y-axis moment, regardless of the load that causes that moment.

#### 8.2. APPROXIMATE INELASTIC MOMENT REDISTRIBUTION

A beam that is reliably restrained at one or both ends by connection to other members or by a support will have reserve capacity past yielding at the point with the greatest moment predicted by an elastic analysis. The additional capacity is the result of inelastic redistribution of moments. This Specification bases the design of the member on providing a resisting moment greater than the demand represented by the greatest moment predicted by the elastic analysis. This approach ignores the reserve capacity associated with inelastic redistribution. The 10% reduction of the greatest moment, predicted by elastic analysis with the accompanying 10% increase in the moment on the reverse side of the moment diagram, is an attempt to account approximately for this reserve capacity.

This adjustment is appropriate only for cases where the inelastic redistribution of moments is possible. For statically determinate spans (e.g., beams that are simply supported at both ends or for cantilevers), redistribution is not possible; therefore, the adjustment is not allowable in these cases. Members with fixed ends or beams continuous over a support can sustain redistribution. Members with cross sections that are unable to accommodate the inelastic rotation associated with the redistribution

<!-- Source: AISC 360-22w_part_25/doc_13.md -->

(e.g., because of local buckling) are also not permitted to use this redistribution. Thus, only compact sections qualify for redistribution in this Specification.

An inelastic analysis will automatically account for any redistribution; therefore, the redistribution of moments only applies to moments computed from an elastic analysis.

The 10% reduction rule applies only to beams. Inelastic redistribution is possible in more complicated structures, but the 10% amount is only verified, at present, for beams. For other structures, the provisions of Appendix 1, Section 1.3, should be used.

To further accommodate the inelastic rotation associated with the moment redistribution, unbraced lengths must also be limited to a maximum unbraced length of  $ L_{m} $ . The magnitude of  $ L_{m} $  is often larger than  $ L_{p} $ , because the  $ L_{m} $  expression accounts for moment gradient directly, while designs based upon an elastic analysis rely on  $ C_{b} $  factors from Section F1.1 to account for the benefits of moment gradient. Equations A-8-9 and A-8-10 define the maximum permitted unbraced length in the vicinity of redistributed moment for doubly symmetric and singly symmetric I-shaped members with a compression flange area equal to or larger than the tension flange area bent about their major axis, and for solid rectangular bars and symmetric box beams bent about their major axis, respectively. In general, these provisions have been a part of the AISC Specification since the 1949 edition (AISC, 1949). Equations A-8-9 and A-8-10 are identical to those in Appendix 1 of the 2005 AISC Specification (AISC, 2005b) and the 1999 LRFD Specification (AISC, 2000b), and are based on research reported in Yura et al. (1978). They are different from the corresponding equations in Chapter N of the 1989 AISC Specification (AISC, 1989).
